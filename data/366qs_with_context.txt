When the channel is accessed, the transmission within the channel occupancy can occur following the procedures in Clause 4.4.2 before switching to a different beam within the channel occupancy.\n\nWhen the gNB intends to transmit a DL transmission(s) across multiple transmission beams, if the gNB performs sensing on the corresponding sensing beam(s) independently, the DL transmission(s) can occur on a transmission beam(s) among the multiple transmission beams if the channel access procedures on the corresponding sensing beam(s) have succeeded, and the channel occupancy would start at the same time across the multiple transmission beams.

Further, it is assumed that synchronization signal can be located in the same slot as paging-on slot and UE can finish network synchronization before paging monitoring. For longer paging cycle, one SSB-burst can still be assumed. In addition, to improve synchronization accuracy, the case of two SSB-burst sets is also evaluated. In this case, UE needs additional time up to one SSB cycle for SSB reception.\n\nFor paging monitoring, a paging occasion can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. slot or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent. NOTE\u00a08:\tIn RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED mode, the PDB requirement for these 5QIs can be relaxed (but not to a value greater than 320\u00a0ms) for the first packet(s) in a downlink data or signalling burst in order to permit reasonable battery saving (DRX) techniques.\n\nNOTE\u00a09:\tIt is expected that 5QI-65 and 5QI-69 are used together to provide Mission Critical Push to Talk service (e.g. 5QI-5 is not used for signalling). It is expected that the amount of traffic per UE will be similar or less compared to the IMS signalling. For NR, DRX is supported for UEs in idle, inactive and connected states.\n\n4.8.3.2\tEvaluation of sleep ratio\n\nFor idle state and inactive state, the UE should monitor one paging occasion per discontinuous reception (DRX) cycle (which equals to the paging cycle), and the UE can use DRX to reduce power consumption. Before paging receiving, the SSB monitoring is needed. Also, RRM measurement(s), including intra- and inter-cell shall be performed."

Non-anchor carrier operation\n\n\n\nThere can be up to 15 DL and UL non-anchor carriers configured in a new NB-IoT SIB, used by paging, RAR, or SC-PTM, each identified by its centre frequency. For paging purposes, POs are distributed across the non-anchor carriers in a configurable uneven manner so that the eNB can decide what paging load each carrier should have. For random access, each non-anchor UL carrier has a probability with which the UE may randomly select it for Msg1&3, and corresponds to a DL carrier for Msg2&4; or for ordered random access the carrier for Msg1&3 is indicated by DCI. Contention free random access is supported for NPDCCH ordered random access. Up to three NPRACH resources can be configured on one non-anchor UL carrier. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a different number of NPRACH repetitions.\n\nNPRACH resources in nprach-ParametersListEDT are used to initiate EDT. Each NPRACH resource is associated with a maximum TBS signalled in the corresponding entry of edt-TBS-InfoList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.\n\nE-UTRAN includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in nprach-ParametersList in SystemInformationBlockType2-NB.

The UE in RRC_IDLE, based on broadcast/multicast signaling, can use a non-anchor carrier for SC-PTM reception. The UE in RRC_IDLE can, based on broadcast signaling, use a non-anchor carrier for paging reception. The UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED, based on broadcast signaling, can use a non-anchor carrier for random access. The eNB may broadcast a minimum UE specific DRX value shorter than the cell default DRX value. When UE specific DRX is configured by the upper layers and the minimum UE specific DRX value is broadcast, the UE monitors paging according to the longer of the two values.\n\nCoexistence of NB-IoT with NR (FDD and TDD)\n\nThis feature allows the configuration of the DL/UL resource reservation in subframe/slot/symbol-levels on non-anchor carriers for unicast transmission to avoid resource overlapping with NR channels/signals. If both gwus-Config and wus-Config are present for the carrier, E-UTRAN configures the same value for both fields.\n\nmixedOperationModeConfig\n\nFor FDD: Provides the configuration of DL and UL non-anchor carriers that can be used for paging and random access by a UE that supports mixed operation mode.\n\nFor TDD: This parameter is absent.\n\nnB\n\nParameter: nB is used as one of parameters to derive the Paging Frame and Paging Occasion according to TS 36.304 [4].

Thus, it is necessary to evaluate performance of the ML entity during the inference process. Therefore, the solution described in clause 5.2.5.4 is a feasible solution to be developed further in the normative specifications.\n\n5.2.6\tPerformance evaluation for AI/ML inference\n\n5.2.6.1\tDescription\n\nIn the AI/ML inference phase, the performance of the inference function and ML model need to be evaluated against consumer's provided performance expectations/targets, in order to identify and timely fix any problem. Actions to fix any problem would be e.g. to trigger the ML model/entity re-training, testing, and re-deployment. Depending on the use case, one or more inference trustworthiness techniques can be applied on the deployed ML model. Therefore, the AI/ML inference producer can be queried to provide information on the supported inference trustworthiness capabilities enabling the AI/ML inference consumer to request for a subset of supported inference trustworthiness characteristics to be configured, measured, and reported.\n\n5.3.1.2.5\tAssessment of AI/ML trustworthiness\n\nThe ML assessment may need to be performed according to the desired trustworthiness measure of the ML model. For example:\n\n-\tThe ML model can be tested to evaluate the correctness of explanations, quality of explanations, robustness of explanations and adaptiveness of explanations. For example, as stated in 3GPP TS\u00a028.104\u00a0[2], \"an MDA Function may optionally be deployed as one or more AI/ML inference function(s) in which the relevant models are used for inference per the corresponding MDA capability.\" Similarly, owing to the differences in the kinds and complexity of intents that need to be fulfilled, an intent fulfilment solution may need to employ the capabilities of existing AI/ML to fulfil the intents. In any such case, management services are required to identify the capabilities of those existing ML entities. -\tInference Output: Data used by the Management function to monitor the performance of AI/ML models or AI/ML functionalities.\n\n-\tModel Storage is a function responsible for storing trained/updated models that can be used to perform the Inference function.\n\n-\tNote: The Model Storage function in Figure 4.4-1 is only intended as a reference point (if any) when applicable for protocol terminations, model transfer/delivery, and related processes. It should be stressed that its purpose does not encompass restricting the actual storage locations of models. -\tManagement Instruction: Information needed as input to manage the Inference function. Concerning information may include selection/(de)activation/switching of AI/ML models or AI/ML-based functionalities, fallback to non-AI/ML operation (i.e., not relying on inference process), etc\u2026\n\n-\tModel Transfer/Delivery Request: Used to request model(s) to the Model Storage function.\n\n-\tPerformance Feedback / Retraining Request: Information needed as input for the Model Training function, e.g., for model (re)training or updating purposes.

        "option 3": "Split charging between parties",
        "option 4": "Charge for each component separately in a session",
        "option 5": "Different rules for session setup and session resources",
        "answer": "option 1: \"Calling Party Pays\" charging principle",
        "explanation": "During an active session, the \"Calling Party Pays\" charging principle should be possible to apply.",
        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "The individual resource set-up and usage should be separately identified. This supports the \"Calling Party Pays\" model;\n\n\tDuring an active session, media types can change (e.g. audio changed to data) and shall be charged for appropriately. It is thus necessary to be able to detect a change of media during a session so that different rating may be applied.\n\nIt should also be noted that during a multi-party session, normally if the charged party drops off the session, all components being charged to that party should drop. But it is foreseeable to support a service option that allows the charged party to continue to be charged even if they drop off the session. The charging rules should support this option. The charging options shall adequately account for all session resources used in order to enable the operators to apply flexible billing policies and to satisfy regional and/or national regulatory policies.\n\nIn general, any session shall allow for the following charging options:\n\nTo apply the \"Calling Party Pays\" charging principle;\n\nA 3rd party to be charged for all or part of the session; \n\nSplit charging between any of the parties, including 3rd parties; \n\nSession setup and session resources to have different charging rules. Different rules would be applied for example, in a scenario where A calls an advertising number, say B. B could be a web-based toy advertisement number, for example. 4.2.3.5.4\tCharging concepts for Service Level Tracing for IMS\n\nCharging for Service Level Tracing for IMS shall be fulfilled using IMS charging mechanism as specified in TS\u00a032.240\u00a0[19] and TS\u00a032.260\u00a0[20]. \n\nIt shall be possible to apply specific tariffs (e.g. zero rating) to the bearer and/or signalling traffic associated with services subjected to Service Level Tracing for IMS.\n\nAs described in subclause 4.2.3.5 an IMS NE that has an active trace session should start a trace recording session when it detects a service level tracing Start Triggering Event. Depending on the results of the connectivity checks, one of the candidate addresses may be promoted to become the active transport address.\n\nDepending on the active transport address, provide additional information in the session description to insure that correct policy and charging functionality can be applied on relayed media packets.\n\nGiven the desire to minimize session establishment delays during connectivity checks, the UE shall advertise its active address in the SDP offer or answer in the following order based on their availability:\n\n1.\tSTUN relay server assigned address;\n\n2.\tSTUN derived address;\n\n3.\tLocally assigned address. Data volumes retransmitted (by RLC or LLC) due to poor radio link conditions shall not be counted.\n\nThe following additional fields are applicable in the P-GW CDR when charging per IP-CAN session is active and IP-CAN bearer charging is being performed for the session:\n\n-\tCharging Id In case of IP-CAN bearer specific container this contains the charging Id assigned to the bearer. \n\n-\tRAT Type This field contains the RAT type for the current IP-CAN bearer.\n\n-\tAccess Availability Change Reason indicates the reason why the availability of an access is changed by the PCEF, i.e. RAN rule indication or Access usable/unusable as defined in TS\u00a029.212 [220]. The Charging method is mandatory if there is no default charging method for the PDU Session.\n\nNOTE\u00a06:\tWith converged charging architecture for 5GC, online charging method also includes usage reporting from the SMF to the CHF. Hence, setting the charging method to online will also result in usage reports and thus allow for offline charging being performed by the CHF.\n\nThe Service Data Flow handling while requesting credit indicates either \"blocking\" if a credit for the Charging Key needs to be granted as a condition for the PCC Rule to be active or \"non-blocking\" if a credit for the Charging Key has been requested as a condition for the PCC Rule to be active. It shall be possible for operators to be able to charge for individual components of sessions even if there is no identificable service. For example, a proprietary codec may be used to set up an \"end-to-end\" speech session where the network operator acts as a \"bit-pipe\". In this case, it should be possible for the operator to charge for this differentially. This type of component is called \"datastream\" in the table below. \n\nIt might not be possible to apply some of the charging mechanism and type options described below depending on the capability of the networks used."

These are a set of specificities offered by the 5G system, as detailed in the following sections. It covers aspects such as network slicing, network capability exposure, scalability, and diverse mobility, security, efficient content delivery, and migration and interworking. On the commercial side, industrial control, industrial automation, UAV control, and AR are examples of those services. Services such as UAV control will require more precise positioning information that includes altitude, speed, and direction, in addition to horizontal coordinates.\n\nSupport for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) brings many new requirements in addition to those for the enhanced KPIs. The expansion of connected things introduces a need for significant improvements in resource efficiency in all system components (e.g. UEs, IoT devices, radio, access network, core network).\n\nThe 5G system also aims to enhance its capability to meet KPIs that emerging V2X applications require. 7\tGeneric description of the MSGin5G Service (informative)\n\n7.1\tGeneral\n\nMassive Internet of Things (MIoT) is one of key market segments of 5G.

The format of the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" may be defined by stage-3 but an example is that the \"Service Experience Contribution Weight\" may be an integer value with a range that is agreed on between the MNO and AF where a higher value indicates more importance than a lower value. When the AF provides Service Experience Information and the Target of Analytics Reporting is one or more UE ID(s), the AF may also provide a Service Experience Contribution Weight with each UE's Service Experience value.

The charging information is utilized by CCS in one converged charging service which offers charging with and without quota management, as well as charging information record generation. \n\n\n\n\n4.2\tHigh level common architecture\n\n4.2.1\tGeneral\n\nThe architectural differences between the domains (e.g. PS), services (e.g. MMS) and subsystems (e.g. the IMS) affect the way in which the charging functions are embedded within the different domains, services and subsystems. However, the functional requirements for charging are always the same across all domains, services and subsystems. In online charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Online Charging System (OCS) or to the Converged Charging System (CCS). The OCS or CCS, in turn, may have an offline charging reference point used to forward charging information to the BD that is similar in scope and intent to the offline charging case described in the previous paragraph. Those areas of the OCS and CCS that form part of the 3GPP standards (functions, reference points and service based interface) are also described in the present clause. All other aspects of the OCS and CCS are outside the scope of 3GPP. This makes it essential that the converged charging interface is optimized in regard to the amount of information and number of reports sent, or at least allows for such an optimization if needed.\n\nThe information that may be used to assist the determine of reservation in the CCS is not defined except for the rating group. This means that for an immediate event or in an initial request the information about the event or session is limited and lacks accuracy.\n\nLow latency requirements increased by new business cases may need enhancements to the non-blocking mechanism.\n\nCharging of new service together with converged charging have increased the need for more information in the input to rating.\n\nThe use of event-based charging has led to a need for cancelling the charging for the chargeable event, e.g. 4\tOverview\n\nThe Nchf converged charging services was first released in Rel-15. This first iteration was to a large extent, with some minor exceptions, copying and combining its predecessors, Ro and Rf, based on Diameter to a service based interface (SBI) supporting converged charging service. The depiction of the internal architecture of the Converged Charging System (CCS) was to a large extent based on the Online Charging System (OCS).\n\nThe combination of the Diameter Ro and Rf interfaces into one converged charging service together with the move of the integration point for CDRs have led to that all the information previously reported and transported over two or more interfaces now needs to be transported over a single interface. Figure 4.3.3.0.1: Logical ubiquitous converged charging architecture\n\n4.3.3.1\tCharging Trigger Function (CTF)\n\nThe Charging Trigger Function (CTF) interacts with the Charging Function (CHF) of the Converged Charging System (CCS) using Nchf interface for consuming CHF services as defined in TS 32.290 [57]:\n\n-\tconverged charging (Nchf_ConvergedCharging service) wich operates:\n\n-\twith quota management (online charging);\n\n-\twithout quota management (offline charging);\n\n-\toffline only charging (Nchf_OfflineOnlyCharging service). The Charging Data Request is issued by the NEF towards the CHF when certain conditions (chargeable events) are met.\n\nConverged charging uses centralized or decentralized unit determination and centralized rating scenarios for event based convergent charging specified in TS 32.290 [57].\n\nThe contents and purpose of each charging event that triggers interaction with CHF, as well as the chargeable events that trigger them, are described in the following clauses.\n\nA detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters defined in the present document is to be found in TS\u00a032.291 [58].\n\nA detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present document is to be found in TS\u00a032.298 [51]."

The 3GPP network shall be able to make and enforce policy decisions regarding relative treatment of MPS application services traffic depending on the media type subject to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policy (e.g., based on operator policy or regulation, Voice may have higher priority than Video or Data).\n\n5.13\tPriority before service invocation\n\n5.13.1\tOverview of priority before service invocation\n\nProviding priority treatment to MPS-subscribed UEs during attachment/registration for radio access and network connectivity before the MPS application service session invocation requests improves the probability of an MPS session request being successful. This involves providing priority treatment for the signalling during the UE attachment for radio access and network connectivity based on a subscription profile. The MPS-subscribed UE, based on the MPS IMS subscription information, operator's policy and national/regional regulations, may be given priority treatment for the default bearer and the EPS bearer carrying IMS signalling in the EPS prior to and during IMS-based MPS invocation. Further, priority treatment in the EPS for signalling and media bearers may be modified/established via dynamic PCC based on the session authorization information received from the AF.\n\nAs the IMS media bearer is established after the IMS session of the MPS service has been established, it can be assigned with correct ARP value when it is established.

MPS provides priority treatment to increase the probability of an authorized Service User\u2019s Voice, Video, and Data communication session being successful. Some form of priority treatment is applied to the MPS invocation and session establishment, and continues to be applied until the MPS session is released. The priority treatment may be applied before the invocation if a greater probability of success in receiving, recognizing, and processing the invocation is needed.\n\nMPS allows qualified and authorized users to obtain priority access to the next available radio channel on a priority basis before other PLMN users, during situations when PLMN congestion is blocking session establishment attempts. In addition, MPS supports priority sessions on an \"end-to-end\" priority basis. A new Subclause 5.12 (Policy Control) was added to include requirements to make and enforce relative priority decision between different MPS application services subject to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policy.\n\n\n\n\tA new Subclause 5.13 (Priority before service invocation) was added to include requirements to provide advance priority treatment in radio access networks, that is, subscription-based priority is provided in advance of service invocation to provide priority in support of the service invocation signaling. 9.3.4\tSignalling\n\nThe system shall provide priority treatment to the invocation signalling in the network once the MPS for DTS request is identified by the system.\n\nThe system shall support a means for MPS for DTS activation when normal data service is congested.\n\n9.3.5\tMedia\n\nThe system shall provide priority treatment to the affected media flows when an MPS for DTS session is activated.\n\nThe system shall provide priority treatment to the affected media flows when MPS for DTS is activated for the connection between an MPS subscribed UE or IoT device and an associated enterprise network supporting MPS.\n\nNOTE:\tBoth the MPS subscribed UE or IoT device and the enterprise network must be served by the same PLMN."

        "context": "The gNB-CU may then retrieve the RA Report from the UE(s) based on the RACH indication received via F1AP signalling from the gNB-DU.\n\n7.6\tPositioning\n\nThe NG-RAN supports the positioning functionality as specified in TS 38.305 [25].\n\n7.7\tSupport for NR MBS\n\nThe Support of NR MBS in non-split gNB case is specified in TS 38.300 [2].\n\n7.7.1\tSupport of dynamic PTP and PTM switching\n\nFor UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, NG-RAN supports dynamic switch between PTP and PTM for MBS as specified in TS 38.300 [2]. There are many different possible uses for the positioning information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the 5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the network, and by \"third party\" services. The feature may also be used by an emergency service (which may be mandated or \"value-added\"), but the location service is not exclusively for emergencies.\n\nDesign of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. The case that the NG-RAN node functions as an LCS client is not supported in this version of the specification.\n\n5.3\tNG-RAN Positioning Operations\n\n5.3.1\tGeneral NG-RAN Positioning Operations\n\nSeparately from location service support for particular UEs, an LMF may interact with elements in the NG-RAN in order to obtain measurement information to help assist one or more position methods for all UEs. An LMF may also interact with NG-RAN node to provide assistance data information for broadcasting. This goal also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15], [16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be compatible where appropriate.\n\nAs a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the following assumptions apply:\n\n-\tboth TDD and FDD will be supported;\n\n\t-\tthe provision of the UE Positioning function in NG-RAN and 5GC is optional through support of the specified method(s) in the ng-eNB, gNB and the LMF;\n\n-\tUE Positioning is applicable to any target UE, whether or not the UE supports LCS, but with restrictions on the use of certain positioning methods depending on UE capability (e.g. The current NG-RAN positioning architecture can in principle be re-used to support Sidelink Positioning in in-coverage and partial coverage scenarios.\n\n5.2.2.2\tSidelink Positioning Protocol (SLPP) \n\nWith regards to the sidelink positioning procedures between UEs, SLPP is introduced to support at least the following functionalities:\n\n-\tSL Positioning Capability Transfer\n\n-\tSL Positioning Assistance Data exchange\n\n-\tSL Location Information Transfer\n\n-\tError handling\n\n-\tAbort\n\nThe cast type for SLPP signaling is studied, including unicast, groupcast and broadcast.\n\nUnicast/one-to-one operation is assumed as baseline for exchange of SLPP signaling between UEs. A gNB-DU which includes TRP functionality does not need to offer cell services.\n\n5.2\tUE Positioning Operations\n\nTo support positioning of a target UE and delivery of location assistance data to a UE with NG-RAN access in 5GS, location related functions are distributed as shown in the architecture in Figure 5.1-1 and as clarified in greater detail in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.273 [35]. The overall sequence of events applicable to the UE, NG-RAN and LMF for any location service is shown in Figure 5.2-1. technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.\n\nz\tthe third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been incorporated in the document.\n\n\n1\tScope\n\nThe present document specifies the stage 2 of the UE Positioning function of NG-RAN which provides the mechanisms to support or assist the calculation of the geographical position of a UE. UE position knowledge can be used, for example, in support of Radio Resource Management functions, as well as location-based services for operators, subscribers, and third-party service providers. The purpose of this stage 2 specification is to define the NG-RAN UE Positioning architecture, functional entities and operations to support positioning methods. This description is confined to the NG-RAN Access Stratum."

When in use, PSBCH transmits MIB-V2X every 160 ms in the central 72 subcarriers of the SL bandwidth. In distributed congestion control, the UE adjusts its own transmission parameters within the allowed range which is a function of CBR measurement.\n\n\n\n\tEnhancement to sidelink synchronization using sidelink signals/channels\n\n\n\nSidelink transmission modes 3 and 4 in the existing specification can use either GNSS signal or the eNB signal as the synchronization reference, so no sidelink operation is possible when a UE cannot receive either signal. The RAN WI enhances this so that a UE operating PC5 based V2X can transmit and receive SLSS (SideLink Synchronization Signal)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3GPP\n\n\n\n\t\tRelease 14\t27\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05) 3GPP\n\n\n\n\t\tRelease 14\t27\t3GPP TR 21.914 V14.0.0 (2018-05)\n\n\n\nwhich can be used as another type of synchronization reference in sidelink communications. Two UEs using the same SLSS as their synchronization reference can align their time and frequency references before transmitting and receiving V2X messages even when no GNSS signal or eNB signal is detected.\n\n\n\n\tSupport of simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers\n\n\n\nThe RAN WI extends the V2X operation scenarios by supporting simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers. They jointly convey the SLSS ID selected by the UE. For further details of SLSS and synchronization, refer to Clause 5.1.2. PSSS/SSSS also allow UEs to detect the sidelink subframe boundary, with subframe number and frame number signalled in MIB-V2X.\n\nPSSCH transmits the SL-SCH transport channel, which carries the TBs of data for transmission over SL. For sidelink discovery, the synchronisation information concerns a Sidelink Synchronisation Signal (SLSS) and, in case of PS related discovery, also timing information and some additional configuration parameters (i.e. the MasterInformationBlock-SL message), while for sidelink communication or V2X sidelink communication it concerns an SLSS and the MasterInformationBlock-SL or MasterInformationBlock-SL-V2X message. A UE transmits synchronisation information either when E-UTRAN configures it to do so by dedicated signalling (i.e. network based), or when not configured by dedicated signalling (i.e. Sidelink synchronization can also operate on multiple carriers, as mentioned in Clause 5.1.2. In addition, in sidelink CA operation, a SyncRef UE uses a single synchronization reference for all aggregated carriers, and may transmit SLSS/PSBCH on one or multiple of them according to capability. A receiving UE likewise uses the same synchronization reference (not necessarily a SyncRef UE) for all its aggregated carriers, and it uses the highest priority synchronization reference present among the available synchronization carriers.\n\nAnother form of CA is PDCP duplication, where the same PDCP packet is transmitted in parallel on multiple sidelink carriers, to increase reliability.

The UE encodes the capability information message, then divides the encoded message into segments such that the size of each segment does not exceed the maximum size of a PDCP SDU (8188 octets in E-UTRA, 9000 octets in NR); the RAN node (eNB or gNB) receives the segments and reassembles them to reconstruct the original capability information message. The work is divided into two subfeatures, UE radio capability ID and UE capability segmentation.\n\nUE Radio Capability ID\n\nThe SA2 work item [5] specified system optimisations for the 5GS (documented in TS\u00a023.501 [3]) and for the EPS (documented in TS\u00a023.401 [4]), that apply to both NR and E-UTRA, but not NB-IoT, consisting of using UE Radio Capability IDs as an alternative to signaling the UE Radio Capabilities container in system procedures:\n\n-\tbetween the UE and the CN (over Uu)\n\n-\tbetween the CN and the RAN (impacting N2/S1 interfaces)\n\n-\twithin the RAN in e.g. Figure 1: UCMF architecture and related reference points in 5GS (left) and EPS (right)\n\nSystem procedures are defined for 5GS in TS\u00a023.502 [6] and for EPS in TS\u00a023.401 [4]. \n\nUE Capability Segmentation\n\nThe RAN work item [10] calls for specification of a segmentation mechanism, so that in cases of excessively large UE capability signalling (e.g. capability information messages exceeding the maximum size of a PDCP SDU), the capability can be segmented into multiple RRC messages. Segmentation applies to both NR and E-UTRA and is captured respectively in [11] and [12]. rrc-SegAllowed\n\nA one-shot field that indicates that the UE is enabled to segment the response message into a series of ULDedicatedMessageSegment messages.\n\n\n\n\u2013\tUECapabilityInformation\n\nThe UECapabilityInformation message is used to transfer of UE radio access capabilities requested by the EUTRAN.\n\nSignalling radio bearer: SRB1\n\nRLC-SAP: AM\n\nLogical channel: DCCH\n\nDirection: UE to EUTRAN\n\nUECapabilityInformation message\n\n-- ASN1START 9.9.3.34\tUE network capability\n\nThe purpose of the UE network capability information element is to provide the network with information concerning aspects of the UE related to EPS or interworking with GPRS and 5GS. The contents might affect the manner in which the network handles the operation of the UE. The UE network capability information indicates general UE characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the channel it is sent on.\n\nThe UE network capability information element is coded as shown in figure\u00a09.9.3.34.1 and table\u00a09.9.3.34.1.

For example, the CCO functionality can be used to satisfy the autonomy capabilities identified in level 3 for coverage optimization.

The appropriate tariff information to the network elements is distributed by the Advice of Charge supplementary service. The function is specified in TS 32.280 [40].\n\nAn alternative mode of AoC can also be used to indicate the occurrence of new charges to the user, e.g. when a monthly allowance is being exceeded, or when a service is requested that is not included in the subscription fees, while others are. 11a.3\tHome Environment / Serving Network Identification\n\nHome / serving environments need to route communication to the current location of the user.

In this new registration type or indicator, the UE also indicates the identifier of the hosting network to its home network.\n\nWhen a home network receives simultaneous registration requests with the hosting network re-registration information from a high number of its subscribers and cannot accept all the registration requests (congestion), the home network rejects the registration requests with a local hosting network-specific back-off timer.

This includes creating a session for the RN and managing EPS bearers for the RN as shown in clause\u00a04.3.20.3, as well as terminating the S1-AP and S11 interfaces towards the MME serving the RN. Due to the proxy functionality, the DeNB appears as an MME (for S1), an eNodeB (for X2) and an S-GW to the RN.\n\nThe RN and DeNB also perform mapping of signalling and data packets onto EPS bearers that are setup for the RN. NOTE\u00a02:\tFunctions of the MME for the RN and MME for the UE may be collocated in a single MME.\n\nThe RN supports the eNodeB functionality like termination of the radio protocols of the E-UTRA radio interface and the S1 and X2 interfaces. The RN also supports a subset of the UE functionality and protocols to wirelessly connect to the DeNB.\n\nIn addition to supporting eNodeB functionality, the DeNB also embeds and provides the S-GW/P-GW-like functions needed for the RN operation. The X2 control plane protocol stack for supporting RNs is shown in Figure 4.7.4-2. There is a single X2 interface relation between each RN and its DeNB. In addition, the DeNB may have X2 interface relations to neighbouring eNBs. The DeNB processes and forwards all X2 messages between the RN and other eNBs for all UE-dedicated procedures. The processing of X2-AP messages includes modifying S1/X2-AP UE IDs, Transport Layer address and GTP TEIDs but leaves other parts of the message unchanged. RNs terminate X2-AP. In this case, there is one X2 interface relation between the RN and the DeNB.\n\n20.2.1\tX2-CP Functions\n\nThe X2AP protocol supports the following functions:\n\n-\tIntra LTE-Access-System Mobility Support for UE in ECM-CONNECTED:\n\n-\tContext transfer from source eNB to target eNB;\n\n-\tControl of user plane tunnels between source eNB and target eNB;\n\n-\tHandover cancellation.

The RN terminates the S1, X2 and Un interfaces. The DeNB provides S1 and X2 proxy functionality between the RN and other network nodes (other eNBs, MMEs and SGWs). In order to provide the Relay Function the DeNB shall support the following P-GW functions:\n\n-\tIP address allocation for the UE functionality of the RN;\n\n-\tDownlink transport level packet mapping between the DSCP value used over S1-U of the UE (which is the SGi interface of the PDN GW function in the DeNB) and the EPS bearers with an appropriate QCI value and optionally ARP priority level value, established between the PDN GW function in the DeNB and the UE function of the RN;\n\n-\tUplink transport level packet mapping between QCI value and optionally ARP priority level value, -\tthe RRC layer of the Un interface has functionality to send updated system information in a dedicated message to an RN with an RN subframe configuration. The RN applies the received system information immediately;\n\n-\tthe PDCP layer of the Un interface has functionality to provide integrity protection for the user plane. The integrity protection is configured per DRB.\n\nTo support PWS towards UEs, the RN receives the relevant information over S1.

Outdoor-to-indoor coverage may be an issue at 3.5 GHz and will certainly be difficult at mmwave frequencies. Providing coverage with indoor solutions may be the answer; Premises Radio Access Stations (PRASs) can be connected via fixed access. 3GPP together with BBF has provided Wireline Wireless Convergence architecture solutions where fixed access is considered part of the 5G System. 2018 IEEE 29th Annual International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC).

The residential environment is where a large portion of 5G traffic will be handled. And the residential environment is not the easiest environment to provide network coverage. With video/TV services and AR/VR gaming, residential users demand high bitrates and with a concentration of media traffic can easily require significant capacities. High bitrates and high capacity are best provided with mmwave frequencies. However, at mmwave frequencies it will be difficult to provide outside-to-inside coverage with operator base stations. Also with indoor base stations, it will not be easy to provide sufficient indoor coverage.

Example of producers and consumers of management services\n\n\n\n5.1.2\tInteractions between management service producer and management service consumer\n\nThe interactions between the management service producer and management service consumer follows one of the three following paradigms:\n\n-\t\"Request-response\": A management service producer is requested by a management service consumer to invoke an operation, which either performs an action or provides information or both. The management service producer provides response based on the request by management service consumer. After being successfully authenticated, the management service consumer may send request to an authorization service producer to get access token for permissions. After getting access token from an authorization service producer,  the management service consumer sends request to corresponding management service producers to access management services. The management service producer provides response to the consumer after verifying the access token.  Figure 5.1.1.2-4 depicted typical Request-response communication paradigm with access control explicit authentication and authorization mode Figure 5.1.1.2-5: Request-response communication paradigm with access control (implicit authentication and authorization)\n\n\n\n5.2\tManagement interactions with NFV MANO\n\n3GPP management system shall be capable to consume  NFV MANO interface (e.g. Os-Ma-nfvo, Ve-Vnfm-em and Ve-Vnfm-vnf reference points).\n\nProducer of management services can consume management interfaces provided by NFV MANO for following purposes:\n\n-\tNetwork service LCM.\n\n-\tVNF LCM, PM, FM, CM on resources supporting VNF. The management service producer sends the management data, when they are ready, by streaming to the management service consumer over the established connection.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1.2.3: Connect-streaming communication paradigm\n\n-\t\"Request-response with access control\" in explicit authentication and authorization mode: An authentication service producer is requested by a management service consumer for authentication, the authentication service producer authenticates the management service consumer according to information in the request, authentication policies and other information associated to the identity of the management service consumer. After being successfully authenticated, the management service consumer may send request to an authorization service producer to get access token for permissions. Figure 7.1.2-4 shows the principle for a request-response interaction and figure 7.1.2-5 shows an example of a subscribe-notify interaction.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1.2-4: Request response using Indirect Communication\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1.2-5: Subscribe-Notify using Indirect Communication\n\nNOTE:\tThe subscribe request and notify request can be routed by different SCPs.\n\n7.1.3\tNetwork Function Service discovery\n\nA Control Plane Network function (NF) within the 5G Core network may expose its capabilities as services via its service based interface, which can be re-used by Control Plane CN NFs."

        "explanation": "Offline charging is used to convert charging information into CDRs that are post-processed for generating bills.",
        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "These network resources may pertain to bearer (e.g. CS, PS), PDU session (e.g. 5GS), subsystem (e.g. IMS sessions) or service (e.g. MMS) usage / consumption. The various charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nThe purpose of offline charging is to transform the charging information into CDRs that are post-processed within the BD, e.g. for the purpose of generating bills. While the collection of charging information used for the CDRs occurs during the network resource usage, there is no impact of offline charging on the use of the resources. While the collection of charging information used for the CDRs occurs during the network resource usage, there is no impact of offline charging on the use of the resources. All activities involved in the transformation of the charging information into end user bills, and the collection of the end user charges incurred in these bills, occur offline to, or after, the network resource usage.\n\nThe purpose of online charging is to furnish charging information to the OCS/CCS in order to perform Credit-Control before the network resource usage is permitted. To this end, a prepaid subscriber account has to exist in the OCS/CCS, against which the resource usage can be billed. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator\u2019s discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered. For this purpose, IMS offline charging utilises the Charging Data Transfer that is specified in the 3GPP accounting application described in TS 32.299 [50].\n\nThe Charging Data Transfer operation employs the Charging Data Request and Charging Data Response messages. Table 6.1.1.0.1 describes the use of these messages for offline charging. TS 32.25x, TS 32.26x and TS 32.27x).\n\nIn offline charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Billing Domain (BD), where it is processed for billing and/or statistical purposes, at the discretion of the PLMN operator. While the internal functions of the BD are outside the scope of 3GPP standardisation, the reference point for the charging information transfer from the network to the BD does form a part of the 3GPP standards and is therefore also specified in the present clause.\n\nIn online charging, the charging information is transferred from the network to the Online Charging System (OCS) or to the Converged Charging System (CCS). Offline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently for the same chargeable event. Clause 5.5 provides further insight into potential utilisation of the charging information produced by the offline and online charging mechanisms.\n\n4.1.1\tOffline charging\n\nOffline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. In conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered.\n\n4.1.2\tOnline charging\n\nOnline charging is a process where charging information for network resource usage is collected concurrently with that resource usage in the same fashion as in offline charging. However, authorization for the network resource usage must be obtained by the network prior to the actual resource usage to occur. This authorization is granted by the OCS or CCS upon request from the network.\n\nWhen receiving a network resource usage request, the network assembles the relevant charging information and generates a charging event towards the OCS or CCS in real-time. The OCS or CCS then returns an appropriate resource usage authorization."

The GGSN for interworking with the ISP/PDN is the access point of the Packet Domain (see figure 13). The GGSN will either terminate the PPP connection towards the MS or may further relay PPP frames to the PDN. The PPP frames may be tunnelled in e.g. L2TP.

To this aim, it enhances RRM, UE demodulation and base station demodulation: it specifies enhanced RRM core requirements and corresponding RRC signals in respectively TS\u00a036.133 [2] and TS\u00a036.331 [3]. in RP-192721.\n\nIn Rel-13 and 14, the mobility and throughput performance were enhanced to cover high speeds (up to 350 km/h) by specifying the requirements for UE RRM, UE demodulation and base station demodulation, considering the two types of operator\u2019s practical deployments shown in Figures 1 and 2.

Alternatively, figure 2 shows the case where Single Frequency Network (SFN) are deployed. Part 1: RRM requirements enhancements:\n\nIn Release 14 cases (limited to 350\u00a0km/h and single carrier), the latency requirements under DRX configuration up to 1.28s DRX cycle were enhanced by reducing the cell identification delay in connected mode and cell reselection delay in idle mode [1]. \n\nIn Rel-16, considering Carrier Aggregation and speeds up to 500km/h, the following enhanced requirements were introduced to achieve good mobility performance and less paging outage:\n\nEnhanced RRM requirements for active SCells (for 350km/h velocity): \n\nThe same requirements specified in Rel-14 high speed WI are applied to active SCells. 700282\n\nPerf. part: Performance enhancements for high speed\n\nLTE_high_speed-\n\n2 R4\n\nRP-160172\n\n\n\nscenario in LTE\n\nPerf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough some vehicles move with the speed over than 300 km/h, most of requirements are specified under below 350 km/h in existing specifications.

For the signalling based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated towards a specific UE from CN nodes using the MDT mechanism as described in clause 5.1.3 [1]; for the management based case, the QoE Measurement Collection is initiated from OAM targeting an area (without targeting a specific UE).\n\n\n\nReferences The QoE Measurement Collection function supports collection of QoE measurements for MBS communication service. The measurement collection is supported for the following two communication service types:\n\n-\tMBS broadcast;\n\n-\tMBS multicast.\n\nQoE measurement collection for application sessions delivered via MBS broadcast is supported in RRC_CONNECTED, RRC_INACTIVE, and RRC_IDLE states. QoE measurement collection for the application sessions delivered via MBS multicast is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. Both signalling based and management based QoE measurement collection are supported in NR SA and NR-DC. Further details of NR-DC operation can be found in TS 37.340 [21] and clause 21.7. One or more QoE measurement collection jobs can be activated at a UE per service type. The application layer measurement configuration and measurement reporting is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. The QoE Measurement Collection deactivation permanently stops all or some of QoE measurement collection jobs towards a UE, resulting in the release of the corresponding QoE measurement configuration(s) in the UE. When a service is provided within a configured slice, the QoE Measurement Collection for this service type could also be configured together with the corresponding slice scope, so that the user experience of this service could also be evaluated on a per-slice basis. 21\tApplication Layer Measurement Collection\n\n21.1\tOverview\n\nThe QoE Measurement Collection function enables collection of application layer measurements from the UE. The supported service types are:\n\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for DASH streaming services;\n\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services;\n\n-\tQoE Measurement Collection for VR services.\n\nFor DASH, MTSI, VR, the QoE measurement collection is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only, unless the application data is delivered via MBS broadcast communication service.\n\nThe QoE Measurement Collection function supports collection of QoE measurements for MBS communication service. In addition, the gNB includes the MDT session identifiers (Trace Reference and Trace Recording Session Reference) in the corresponding QoE measurement report.\n\n21.6\tQoE Measurement Collection in High Mobility Scenarios\n\nQoE measurements can be confined to high mobility state of the UE and/or to HSDN cells.\n\n21.7\tSupport for RAN visible QoE measurements and reporting in NR-DC\n\nEither the MN or the SN can generate and send a RAN visible QoE configuration to the UE. For management-based QoE, the service type indication, measurement configuration application layer ID, the MCE IP address and QoE measurement status are passed to the target gNB. For RRC_INACTIVE state mobility, QoE measurement configuration(s) of a specific UE can be retrieved from the gNB hosting the UE context when it resumes to the RRC_CONNECTED state.\n\nFor signalling-based QoE, at handover to a target gNB that supports QoE measurement collection, the target gNB decides which of the application layer measurement configurations should be kept or released, e.g., based on application layer measurement configuration information received from the source gNB in Xn/NG signalling. The QoE Measurement Collection function enables the collection of application layer measurements from the UE. The measurements are supported for Streaming services, MTSI services, and VR services. Both signalling based and management based QoE measurement collection are supported. In this Release, basic application layer measurement collection mechanism is supported, and RAN visible QoE measurement mechanism and metrics are supported.\n\nIn the WI, the feature of QoE Measurement Collection function is activated in the NG-RAN either by direct configuration from the OAM system (management-based activation), or by signalling from the OAM via the Core Network (signalling-based activation), using UE-associated signalling."

Nevertheless, since the beamforming is used in HST FR2 deployment, and in addition to the fact that the LoS path has shortest travel distance compared to scattering and reflection, the strong LoS path assumption should remain valid in the HST FR2 tunnel deployment scenario, and thus the LoS pathloss model can be used for the link budget analysis.\n\nTS38.901 RMa LoS model, which is considered in open-space link budget analysis, can be reused in tunnel scenario.

In this regard, leveraging adaptive filtering and non-linear modeling of the residual self-interference to accurately model and cancel the residual self-interference is performed to provide additional mitigation in the digital domain and enable higher MCS. 6.2.2.1\tPower Delay Profile (PDP)\n\nThe PDP should be validated in a Beam-Specific manner.

For multi-robot cooperation, the lateness (1\u00a0\u00b5s) is to be interpreted as the lateness among the command messages of a control event to the group robots.\n\nTo meet the stringent requirements of closed-loop factory automation, the following considerations have to be taken:\n\n-\tLimitation to short-range communications.\n\n-\tUse of direct device connection between the controller and actuators.\n\n-\tAllocation of licensed spectrum. Licensed spectrum can further be used as a complement to unlicensed spectrum, e.g. to enhance reliability.\n\n-\tReservation of dedicated radio interface resources for each link. This includes aspects like closed-loop control applications (e.g., based on programmable logic or motion controllers) and robotics, as well as aspects of computer-integrated manufacturing. Factory automation generally represents a key enabler for industrial mass production with high quality and cost-efficiency. Corresponding applications are often characterised by highest requirements on the underlying communication infrastructure, especially in terms of communication service availability, determinism, and latency. In the Factories of the Future, static sequential production systems will be more and more replaced by novel modular production systems offering a high flexibility and versatility. This involves many increasingly mobile production assets, for which powerful wireless communication and localisation services are required. Each closed-loop control event consists of a downlink transaction followed by a synchronous uplink transaction, both of which are executed within a cycle time. Control events within a manufacturing unit might need to occur isochronously. Factory automation considers application layer transaction cycles between controller devices and sensor/actuator devices. Each transaction cycle consists of (1) a command sent by the controller to the sensor/actuator (downlink), (2) application-layer processing on the sensor/actuator device, and (3) a subsequent response by the sensor/actuator to the controller (uplink). Cycle time includes the entire transaction from the transmission of a command by the controller to the reception of a response by the controller. These improvements are important for addressing the needs of increasingly volatile and globalised markets. A major enabler for all this is cyber-physical production systems based on a ubiquitous and powerful connectivity, communication, and computing infrastructure. The infrastructure interconnects people, machines, products, and all kinds of other devices in a flexible, secure and consistent manner. Several different application areas can be distinguished:\n\n1)\tFactory automation: Factory automation deals with the automated control, monitoring and optimisation of processes and workflows within a factory.

This use case has very stringent requirements in terms of latency and service availability. The required service area is usually bigger than for motion control use cases.

Closed-loop control is often used for the control of continuous processes with tight time-control limits, e.g., the control of a printing press. In this case, one typically relies on periodic communication patterns.

In case the transmitted logging information can be time-stamped by the respective function, determinism is often not mandatory. \n\nIn practice, vertical communication networks serve a large number of applications exhibiting a wide range of communication requirements. Usually, communication is called deterministic if it is bounded by a given threshold for the latency/transmission time. In case of a periodic transmission, the variation of the interval is bounded.\n\n4.4\tControl systems and related communication patterns\n\nThere are preferences in the mapping between the type of control and the communication pattern. Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected. \n\nClosed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication patterns.

The arrangement is illustrated in Figure 7.2-2 and is designed to enhance the system level performance under high density while meeting the latency requirements of V2V. Scheduling assignments (SA or PSCCH) are transmitted in sub-channels using specific RBs across time. Data transmissions associated with said scheduling assignments are occupying adjacent RBs in the same subframe. Note that another variant where SA and associated data transmissions are not necessarily transmitted on adjacent RBs has also been standardized.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3GPP Figure 7.2-2: new arrangement of scheduling assignment and data resources\n\n\n\nFinally for distributed scheduling (a.k.a. Mode 4) a sensing with semi-persistent transmission based mechanism was introduced. V2V traffic from a device is mostly periodic in nature. This was utilized to sense congestion on a resource and estimate future congestion on that resource. Based on estimation resources were booked. This technique optimizes the use of the channel by enhancing resource separation between transmitters that are using overlapping resources.\n\n\n\nThe design is scalable for different bandwidths including 10 MHz bandwidth. A given TB can be transmitted once or twice, with a second transmission occurring a time gap after the first which is indicated in the scheduling SCI.\n\nPSCCH transmits physical layer sidelink control information (SCI), also known as a scheduling assignment (SA). For V2X, PSCCH is transmitted in two frequency-adjacent PRBs, and always carries SCI format 1, defined in TS\u00a036.212 [9, clause 5.4.3.1.2].

SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and can be initiated either by the UE in case of MO-SDT (Mobile Originated SDT) or by the network in case of MT-SDT (Mobile Terminated SDT). The Small Data Transmission (SDT) feature allows data and/or signalling transmission while the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE (i.e. without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED state). Small data transmission procedures have been defined in 3GPP Rel-17 for SDT-RA for both two step and four step RA during RRC Inactive with a view of providing power saving opportunities and reducing overhead signalling. Without well performing UE beam correspondence support, wide usage of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission may not be feasible in practical FR2 deployments. To enable efficient use of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission in FR2 deployments to save UE power with reasonable latencies it is important to develop FR2 UE beam correspondence requirements for RRC_INACTIVE in Rel-18. 5.27\tSmall Data Transmission\n\n5.27.1\tGeneral\n\nThe MAC entity may be configured by RRC with SDT and the SDT procedure may be initiated by RRC layer for MO-SDT or MT-SDT.

The area accuracy is used to allow the LCS architecture to report the UE location within the tolerant granularity. Besides, two approaches (i.e. decided by UE and decided by NF) are proposed to address how to report the UE location only when the UE locates the target area defined with the finer granularity:\n\n-\tApproach A: Decided by UE. Additionally, UEs may optionally support privacy notification and verification on behalf of a user. Privacy override is also supported for regulatory LCS services according to local regulation.\n\nThe capabilities of a target UE to support LCS may be signalled by the UE to a serving PLMN or to an SNPN at the AS, NAS and application (positioning protocol) levels to enable use of position methods supported by the UE.\n\nTo provide Location Service in the EPC interworking scenario, an EPC and 5GC common interface shall be used for the location request from LCS client or AF.\n\nRanging based services and Sidelink Positioning for a UE can be supported, and details are described in clause\u00a05.17. as follows:\n\nI.\tTarget UE (with Vetting functionality): the Target UE interacts directly with SL Positioning Client UEs.

With the requirements from the NWDAF or some power saving requirements, the LCS architecture is required to report the UE location only when the UE locates in the exact target area to accomplish the power-saving purpose or signalling reduction purpose.\n\nThis solution addresses the following two points on the LCS side:\n\n1)\tdelivers the detailed target area information from LCS service demander including NWDAF to the UE;\n\n2)\tenables the UE to trigger the area event reporting only when the UE locates in the exact target area or enables the LMF to judge whether the UE location is in the target area or not, which is defined with the finer granularity. Additionally, one or multiple SL Reference UEs need to be involved to position a target UE using PC5.\n\nThis solution proposes to introduce a signalling framework to enable PC5-MT-LR and PC5-MO-LR LCS procedures supporting sidelink positioning and ranging, given the above.\n\n6.34.2\tFunctional descriptions\n\nIn a network scenario, it is the GMLC (with assistance from the UDM) that authorizes LCS Clients/AF and ensures the privacy of a Target UE is respected. In UE-only scenario, without any network entity to rely on, it should be considered whether a UE could host Vetting functionality. -\tUPSubscribe: It enables a consumer NF to subscribe about status of a secure LCS-UP connection for a target UE.\n\n-\tUPNotify: It notifies the consumer NF of the status or modification of a secure LCS-UP connection for a target UE.\n\n-\tUPConfig: It enables a consumer NF to set up, modify or terminate a secure LCS-UP connection for a target UE. reporting based on the cell or TA level as the Rel-17 does, reporting only when the UE locates in the exact target area, multiple scheme reporting).

AN MPS Service Provider network recognizes an MPS invocation based on the presence of an MPS-unique identifier entered by the originating Service User in the service request received by the network from the UE, or based on the subscription profile of the originating UE, or as a regional/operator option the subscription profile of the terminating UE. The priority treatment shall apply whether the MPS non-voice PDU session moves with the MPS voice PDU session or not.\n\n5.11\tNetwork Management Functions\n\nBased on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, an MPS session shall be exempted from network management controls up to the point where further exemption would cause network instability. Congestion controls, overload controls, load balancing, and load re-balancing shall not adversely impact MPS.\n\n5.12\tPolicy Control\n\nThe 3GPP network shall be able to make and enforce policy decisions regarding relative treatment of MPS application services (Voice, Video and Data) for admission control subject to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator policy. Network Interconnection and Protocol Interworking: A Service User\u2019s MPS invocation and session establishment will involve transport and processing, and the end-to-end signaling and media path may traverse multiple MPS Service Provider networks.

Therefore, MPS traffic volumes should be limited (e.g. not to exceed a regional/national specified percentage of any concentrated network resource, such as eNodeB capacity), so as not to compromise this function.\n\n5.2\tPriority session treatment in originating network\n\nWhen an MPS session is originated by a Service User, the session shall receive priority treatment (priority access to signalling and media bearer resources for voice, video, and data) in the originating PLMN based on the originating Service User priority information (i.e., priority indication and priority level). Service Users are government-authorized personnel, emergency management officials and/or other authorized users.

Further information is provided in Table 4.1 of TS\u00a022.071\u00a0[18].\n\nWhen a location client requires a location accuracy the location client may include in the request to the GMLC:\n\n-\tA response time (no delay, low delay, delay tolerant). In the event that a particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE. In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].\n\nThe uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the activity of the UE.

The authorization of multiple chargeable events as per the \"event based charging\" description in clause 5.1 is not yet covered in the above scenario. In contrast, assigning high reservations avoids the above problems, but may interdict the user from the execution of additional, parallel resource usages: due to the high previous reservation, there is no credit left on the account for another resource usage request. The situation described in this paragraph is particularly complex when correlation between multiple charging levels is necessary, see clause 5.3.4. A potential method of relieving this problem is the pooling of credit quotas as described in clause 5.5.2 below.\n\nThe middle tier TSs specify the chargeable events and the content of the associated charging events and responses. The authorization of multiple chargeable events as per the \"event based charging\" description in clause 5.1 is not yet covered in the above scenario.\n\nSession based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. In this scenario, it is generally required that the network can guarantee resource usage execution in order to avoid over-billing the user.\n\n- \tUnit Reservation: the OCS/CCS cannot a priori know the amount of resources that the end user may eventually consume, or it cannot be assumed a priori that the resource usage request can be (completely) fulfilled. In this case, a certain amount of (monetary or non-monetary) units is blocked, or reserved, on the subscriber\u2019s account on the OCS/CCS, and permission to use an amount of resources that matches the unit reservation is returned to the network. -\tAfter completion (or failure) of the resource usage, the NE informs the OCS accordingly about the completion or failure;\n\n-\tIn line with the result report from the network element, the OCS either debits the reserved amount from the subscriber account (success), or it returns the reserved amount back to the subscriber account (failure).\n\nThe following exceptions and abnormal cases are defined for the ECUR scenario:\n\n1)\tThe OCS rejects the resource usage request.

A served user can use a single UE to receive calls addressed to any of its identities and to make calls using any of its identities.\n\nThe MuD and MiD services can be used at the same time.\n\nThe UE can indicate to the network which identities are active at the UE. If the identity is not active at the UE, the user cannot use given identity in a communication at the UE. One example is for a user wishing to be able to use the work identity for the private phone. I.e. originated calls should show the work identity and terminating calls to the work identity should go to the private phone and include information that the work identity is called. Another example is to use a group identity, where employees can make calls on behalf of the group or firm and calls to the group are distributed to any member of the group.\n\nThe Multi-Device (MuD) service is an operator specific service which enables a user to use different UEs that are registered under the same public user identity.

        "category": "Standards overview",
        "context": "This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture.\n\nOn the Core Network side, the 5G System offers also a wide array of new characteristics, such as a deeper use of Network Slicing, Mobile Edge Computing or Network Capability Exposure. All these concepts are presented below. While section 5.4 focusses on the 5G CN with 5G AN (the SA solution), this section deals with the 5G AN connected to the 4G CN (the NSA solution).\n\nAlthough limited, the impacts on 4G CN to make it support a 5G AN are not null. These have been studied and covered in the EDCE5 work item, \"EPC enhancements to support 5G New Radio via Dual Connectivity\".\n\nThe NSA is described in clause 4.1.2 of TS 37.340 on \" NR; Multi-connectivity; Overall description; Stage-2\". Various PDU session types are supported including IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, Ethernet and Unstructured.\n\nThe 5G's main characteristic is the introduction of a new radio interface, the New Radio (NR), which offers the flexibility needed to support these very different types of services.\n\nAnother key characteristic of 5G is that the 5G Access Network can connect not only to a new 5G Core Network but also to the 4G (LTE) Core Network. This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture. Interworking between the 5GS and 4G is supported, where 4G is an E-UTRAN connected to the EPC. This is enabled by evolved Packet Data Gateways (ePDGs) connected to the EPC and the 5G System.\n\nSecurity Edge Protection Proxies (SEPP) are used to secure and hide the topology for inter-PLMN interconnection.\n\n5.5.2.3\tCN protocols\n\nUnique_ID\n\nName\n\nAcronym\n\nWG\n\nWID\n\nWI Rapporteur\n\n750025\n\nCT aspects of 5G System - Phase 1\n\n5GS_Ph1-CT\n\nct\n\nCP-181081\n\nSong Yue (China Mobile) However, here, the term \"eNB\" is used for both cases unless there is a specific need to disambiguate between eNB and ng-eNB.\n\nThe LTE connectivity to 5G-CN feature includes the following key functionalities:\n\n-\t5G NAS message transport\n\n-\t5G security framework, except that data integrity protection is not supported;\n\n-\tUnified Access Control\n\n-\tFlow-based QoS\n\n-\tNetwork slicing\n\n-\tSDAP\n\n-\tNR PDCP\n\n-\tSupport of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state.\n\nGenerally, the above functionalities are introduced based on similar functionalities as in NR. Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in RP-180862.\n\nLTE connectivity to 5G-CN does not only allow RAN level interworking but provides a migration path where the core network is 5G-CN whereas the radio remains LTE. This enables utilization of new functionalities provided by the 5G-CN such as QoS, mobility enhancements and slicing even when using the LTE radio interface.\n\nThe feature \"LTE connectivity to 5G-CN\", or the E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is supported as part of NG-RAN. The E-UTRA can be connected to both EPC and 5GC. A Satellite Radio Interface (SRI) transports the N1/N2/N3 interfaces between the on-ground 5G CN and the on-board gNB-CU. \n\n\n\nFigure 4.2-2: 5GS with regenerative satellite enabled NR-RAN and on-board gNB\n\nAnother implementation in Figure 4.2-3 can note that with a regenerative implementation (either with distributed gNB or not) a 5GS can have a global coverage, providing a single 5G CN with global or regional (continental or sub-continental) coverage as well. The Inter-Satellite Links (ISL) can be used between the satellites."

This applies also to data bearer services with defined QoS parameters (or parameter ranges).\n\nExamples:\n\n-\tA terminating voice call for a subscriber with a dual/multi mode terminal (e.g. On the other hand, network tends to provide service for each UE according to the QoS requirement. However, when many AI/ML applications are running over 5G mobile network, these applications may generate large data traffic and give heavy load to network.\n\nTo reduce the impact on other services in the network and guarantee the quality of AI/ML based service, this solution proposes that the 5GC exposes a recommended service transmission time duration for UE to suggest when to perform AI/ML tasks, which means the network is more likely to provide sufficient network resources in this time duration. dropping of those P frame and B frame makes sense to keep the service when the network resource cannot transmit all of the service data.\n\nHence, the data allowed to be intended dropped shall be authorized by the application server, i.e. from the AF.\n\nThe solution is based on the existing QoS policy control and FAR with the following enhancement:\n\n-\tThe AF provides description of data allowed to be dropped and description of data requiring prioritized transmission. The description of data allowed to be dropped is used to identify the data allowed to be dropped and it should be valid under some conditions, e.g. when the network cannot transmit all of the data of service flow. If a modification of QoS is requested by the MS, which the network can not accept, being unable to provide the requested QoS, it should maintain the QoS negotiated as previously negotiated or propose a new QoS. That means that the network should not reject the MS initiated PDP context modification request due to the unavailability of the QoS. If the MS requested a value for a QoS parameter that is not within the range specified by 3GPP TS 23.107[81], the network should negotiate the parameter to a value that lies within the specified range. Access Category 0 in Table 6.22.2.3-1shall not be barred, irrespective of Access Identities.\n\nNOTE:\tThe network can control the amount of access attempts relating to Access Category 0 by controlling whether to send paging or not.\n\n6.23\tQoS monitoring \n\n6.23.1\tDescription \n\nThe QoS requirements specified for particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication services, and V2X, mandate QoS guarantees from the network. However, the network cannot always guarantee the required QoS of the service. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. Examples:\n\n-\tA terminating voice call for a subscriber with a dual/multi mode terminal (e.g. UTRAN/GERAN) could be delivered in a hybrid network as IM service or CS voice call (TS11). The delivery decision is based on the preferences of service delivery within the user profile and the network conditions. If there is no preference information of the Home environment available the decision is made only on the network conditions from the serving network.\n\n-\tA terminating data service (e.g. PS with QoS for real time audio) where the network cannot provide the QoS at call setup.

        "answer": "option 1: Non-Stand Alone (NSA) and Stand-Alone (SA)",
        "explanation": "The two deployment options for 5G are Non-Stand Alone (NSA) and Stand-Alone (SA).",
        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "All these concepts are presented below.\n\n5.3.2\tThe NSA versus SA architecture\n\nTwo deployment options are defined for 5G: \n\n-\tthe \"Non-Stand Alone\" (NSA) architecture, where the 5G Radio Access Network (AN) and its New Radio (NR) interface is used in conjunction with the existing LTE and EPC infrastructure Core Network (respectively 4G Radio and 4G Core), thus making the NR technology available without network replacement. In this configuration, only the 4G services are supported, but enjoying the capacities offered by the 5G New Radio (lower latency, etc). In this solution two deployment scenarios are considered:\n\n1)\tA 5G VN deployment scenarios with a \"native\" N6 access from UPF to a DN. The UPF thus have access to a \"native\" DN that supports Ethernet in case of Ethernet PDU Sessions and IP payload in case of IP PDU Session types.\n\n2)\tAnother 5G VN deployment scenario where there may not be a \"native\" N6 or DN. Instead, the N6 interface may be running over an underlying transport network. The N6 interface and the DN is thus a virtual network on top of this underlay transport network. As described in e.g. clauses 5.8.2.13 and 5.29.3 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[2], a 5G VN supports connectivity via N6. In 5GS in general, the N6 interface has two purposes that applies also to 5G VN: allow the UEs (5G VN group members) to access entities (e.g. servers) on the DN and enable UE-to-UE communication between UEs served by different SMFs/UPFs.\n\nIn this solution two deployment scenarios are considered:\n\n1)\tA 5G VN deployment scenarios with a \"native\" N6 access from UPF to a DN. The continuation of this section refers to the SA architecture, the NSA being addressed in a subsequent, dedicated, section.\n\n5.3.3\tOverview of the Core Network\n\nIn the SA deployment option, the 5G System (5GS) is composed of the User Equipment, the Access Network (including the \"New Radio\" or NR) and the Core Network (5GC or 5GCN).\n\nThe service requirements, as presented in the previous clause, were used as a basis to define the architecture. The architecture specification (a.k.a. Security is provided for the CU-DU interface. This split was also possible in LTE, but in 5G it is part of the architecture that can support a number of deployment options (e.g. co-located CU-DU deployment is also possible). The DUs, which are deployed at the very edge of the network, don't have access to any user data when confidentiality protection is enabled. Even with the CU-DU split, the air interface security point in 5G remains the same as in LTE, namely in the radio access network.\n\nKey hierarchy: The 5G hierarchy reflects the changes in the overall architecture and the trust model using the security principle of key separation. Instead, the N6 interface may be running over an underlying transport network. The N6 interface and the DN is thus a virtual network on top of this underlay transport network.\n\nThe support of the two deployment scenarios above is optional and only required when a 5G VN involves multiple SMFs, unless the SMFs are deployed in a single SMF Set that is able to handle N19 forwarding as described in solution #3.\n\n6.16.2.2\tNative N6\n\nIn this deployment a native N6 exists, i.e. The deployment choices are dependent on verticals needs and regulation.\n\n6.25.2 \tRequirements\n\nThe 5G system shall support non-public networks.\n\nThe 5G system shall support non-public networks that provide coverage within a specific geographic area.\n\nThe 5G system shall support both physical and virtual non-public networks. \n\nThe 5G system shall support standalone operation of a non-public network, i.e. a non-public network may be able to operate without dependency on a PLMN."

In that case, the resource usage is debited from the subscriber account immediately when processing the charging event, and the permission for the resource usage is returned to the network. An example of this may be the forwarding of a terminating short message from the MSC to the end user. In this scenario, it is generally required that the network can guarantee resource usage execution in order to avoid over-billing the user. To this end, a prepaid subscriber account has to exist in the OCS/CCS, against which the resource usage can be billed. Hence all activities to assess the requested resource usage, to determine its value in monetary or other units, and to debit these units from the subscriber account, must occur prior to or at least, during the resource usage, i.e. online with respect to resource usage. Depending on the circumstances, a final evaluation must occur when resource usage ends.

The LMF sends the Application ID received from the AF to the UE to trigger the UE preforming the 5G ProSe Direct Discovery. LMF may also determine the discovery model for both UE1 and UE2.\n\nWhen the location request is from the external AF, the GMLC will map the external Application ID provided by the AF to a dedicated Application ID. The external Application ID is an Application ID defined in the TS\u00a023.303\u00a0[22] to indicate which application want to know the UE location. The internal Application ID has the same function as the Prose Application ID defined in the TS\u00a023.303\u00a0[22] to trigger the UE to preform Prose direct discovery. The AF subscribes the Network Congestion (e.g. RAN congestion) by sending Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe request (UE address, event ID(s)).\n\n2.\tThe NEF authorizes the AF request.\n\n3.\tThe NEF interacts with the PCF by triggering a Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe request to the Network Congestion (e.g. RAN congestion).\n\n4.\tUpon reception of the subscribe request of Network Congestion for a UE address, the PCF generates a QoS rule for RAN to report RAN's congestion. The PCC rule includes an indication that the PCC rule is used for RAN report information. The AF can be in the MNO domain or an AF external to MNO domain. The data collection request from NWDAF may trigger the AF to collect data from the UE Application. The AF in this clause\u00a0is referred as the Data Collection AF which is described in TS\u00a026.531\u00a0[32].\n\nThe UE Application establishes a connection to the AF in the MNO domain or external to MNO domain over user plane via a PDU session. The AF communicates with the UE Application and collects data from UE Application."

Inter-donor partial migration is only supported for SA-mode.\n\nThe intra-donor IAB-node migration procedure and inter-donor partial migration procedures are captured in TS 38.401 [4].\n\n4.7.4.3\tTopological Redundancy\n\nThe IAB-node may have redundant routes to the IAB-donor-CU(s).\n\nFor IAB-nodes operating in SA-mode, NR DC can be used to enable route redundancy in the BH by allowing the IAB-MT to have concurrent BH links with two parent nodes. The parent nodes may be connected to the same or to different IAB-donor-CUs, which control the establishment and release of redundant routes via these two parent nodes. Since topological redundancy uses NR-DC for the IAB-MT, it is only supported for IAB-nodes operating in the SA mode.\n\nFigure 8.17.2.1-1 shows an example of the inter-CU topological redundancy procedure, where a second backhaul path is established for a dual-connecting IAB-node via a separate IAB-topology that is not controlled by the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. The dual-connecting IAB-DU retains the F1 connection with the F1-terminating IAB-donor-CU. Inter-donor topological redundancy\n\nFor the enhancement of load balancing, Rel-17 IAB further introduces inter-donor topological redundancy. For this purpose, the IAB-MT executes the NR DC procedure to concurrently connect to two IAB-donors. The collocated IAB-DU can establish F1 with either of these two IAB-donors. Inter-donor topological redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-node assumes the role of the boundary node. Inter-donor topological redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-node assumes the role of the boundary node. F1 and non-F1 traffic of the dual-connected IAB-node and its descendent nodes can be gradually migrated between the two paths via either the MN\u2019s or the SN\u2019s IAB-donor-DU. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are used for the coordination between MN and SN IAB-donors for this traffic migration. The boundary node applies BAP header rewriting for all traffic that passes through both IAB-topologies."

One node acts as the MN and the other as the SN. Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) is supported in NG-RAN to allow multi-path transmission for a UE connected to the network via two access nodes.

B.2.2\tCombinations of channel model parameters\n\nThe propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment are indicated as a combination of a channel model name and a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e., NTN-TDLA<DS>-<Doppler>, or NTN-TDLC<DS>-<Doppler> where '<DS>' indicates the desired delay spread and '<Doppler>' indicates the maximum Doppler frequency (Hz).\n\nTable B.2.2-1 show the propagation conditions that are used for the performance measurements in multi-path fading environment for NLOS and LOS propagation conditions.

These observations confirm the analysis that LoS propagation model can be used in the tunnel.\n\n6.2.2\tChannel modelling for performance requirements\n\nBased on WID as follows, RAN4 is tasked to further study the channel model for FR2 HST, where the key question needs to be answer:\n\n-\tWhether or not single-tap per RRH channel model is assumed in UL direction; and\n\n-\tWhether single- or multi-tap model is assumed in DL direction.\n\nCompared with the FR1 counterpart, the major difference of having analog beamforming in FR2 should be considered in determining channel model for performance requirement. As mentioned above, the LoS condition can be considered for most of the areas between the serving RRH and neighboring ones. However, there may be exception in the area under the serving RRH where the serving beam cannot provide coverage directly. Different to the open space scenarios, channel condition w.r.t. the serving RRH in its shadow area is likely NLoS in tunnel due to the rich of the diffuse reflection paths. Nevertheless, from the mobility performance perspective, the impact of such NLoS condition on the HST FR2 deployments may be minor. More specifically, the signal level of the NLoS paths may be rather low as the result of high-order reflections."

There can be more than one NB-IoT carrier configured as described in clause 5.5a. It conveys 504 unique cell identities, as per the secondary synchronization signal.\n\n5.2\tUplink Transmission Scheme\n\n5.2.1\tBasic transmission scheme\n\nFor both FDD and TDD, the uplink transmission scheme is based on single-carrier FDMA, more specifically DFTS-OFDM. It also supports multi-cluster assignment of DFTS-OFDM.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2.1-1: Transmitter scheme of SC-FDMA\n\nThe uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 15 kHz. The sub-carriers are grouped into sets of 12 consecutive sub-carriers, corresponding to the uplink resource blocks. The OFDM sub-carrier spacing is f = 15 kHz. 12 consecutive sub-carriers during one slot correspond to one downlink resource block. In the frequency domain, the number of resource blocks, NRB, can range from NRB-min = 6 to NRB-max = 110 per CC or per Cell in case of CA or DC.\n\nIn addition, there are also four reduced sub-carrier spacings, flow = 7.5 kHz, flow1 = 2.5 kHz, flow2 = 1.25 kHz and flow3 \u2248 0.37 kHz for both MBMS-dedicated cell and MBMS/Unicast-mixed cell. Multi-tone transmission is based on single-carrier FDMA as described in clause 5.2.1, with the difference that resource blocks are not defined. There are 12 consecutive uplink sub-carriers with uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 15 kHz. The sub-carriers can be grouped into sets of 3, 6, or 12 consecutive subcarriers.\n\nA resource unit, schedulable for single-tone NPUSCH with UL-SCH transmission, is defined as a single 3.75 kHz sub-carrier for 32 ms or a single 15 kHz sub-carrier for 8 ms. For single-tone transmission, there are two numerologies defined: 3.75 kHz and 15 kHz subcarrier spacing, based on single-carrier FDMA as described in clause 5.2.1, with the following differences: In the frequency domain, resource blocks are not defined. If the uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 15 kHz, there are 12 consecutive sub-carriers. If the uplink sub-carrier spacing f = 3.75 kHz, there are 48 consecutive sub-carriers.\n\nSingle-tone transmission with 3.75 kHz subcarrier spacing is organized into slots with 2ms duration, each of which consists of seven symbols located from beginning of the slot. There is one cell-specific reference signal transmitted per downlink antenna port. The number of downlink antenna ports for the transmission of cell-specific reference signals equals 1, 2, or 4.\n\nPhysical layer provides 504 unique cell identities using Synchronization signals and resynchronization signals.\n\nThe downlink MBSFN reference signals consist of known reference symbols inserted every other sub-carrier in the 3rd, 7th and 11th OFDM symbol of sub-frame in case of 15 kHz sub-carrier spacing and extended cyclic prefix; every four sub-carriers in the 2nd, 4th and 6th symbol of sub-frame in case of 7.5 kHz sub-carrier spacing; For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, the uplink transmission waveform subcarrier mapping can map to subcarriers in one or more PRB interlaces.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1-1: Transmitter block diagram for CP-OFDM with optional DFT-spreading\n\nThe numerology is based on exponentially scalable sub-carrier spacing f = 2\u00b5 \u00d7 15 kHz with \u00b5={0,1,3,4,5,6} for PSS, SSS and PBCH and \u00b5={0,1,2,3,5,6} for other channels. Normal CP is supported for all sub-carrier spacings, Extended CP is supported for \u00b5=2. 12 consecutive sub-carriers form a Physical Resource Block (PRB). Up to 275 PRBs are supported on a carrier.\n\nTable 5.1-1: Supported transmission numerologies."

        "context": "This work item updates 23.292 (IMS Centralized Services) to introduce optional interworking functionality that enables networks supporting both ICS and IMS to use only the IMS service domain (eliminating service logic and databases in the CS domain); the feature addresses both the service logic execution and the authentication of a network's own subscribers, and also the necessary functionality to support roaming without requiring any functional support in the other network. The IM CN subsystem is also able to interwork with the CS networks (e.g. PSTN, ISDN, CS domain of some PLMN) by supporting transcoding in the IMS MGW element. Furthermore to allow interworking between users of the IM CN subsystem and IP multimedia fixed terminals and other codecs may (this is implementation dependent) be supported by the MGW.\n\nIn order to support existing network capabilities, it is required that IMS supports endpoints (e.g. UE, MRFP, MGCF for interworking with the PSTN) able to send or receive DTMF tone indications using the bearer, i.e. inband signalling. -\tif the supplementary services are provisioned only in the CS domain, the UE can be restricted to configure only the supplementary services for CS speech by setting value \"1\"; and\n\nNOTE\u00a03:\tIf the supplementary services are provisioned in the PS domain, then the supplementary services part of the IMS multimedia telephony communication service can also be configured by a UE accessing the CS domain towards an MSC server enhanced for ICS implementing the interworking between call independent supplementary service signalling and the XCAP application usage for manipulating supplementary services data, as specified in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.292\u00a0[22]. For PSTN terminations, the BGCF determines the network in which PSTN/CS Domain breakout is to occur. If the routing determination is such that the breakout is to occur in the same network in which the BGCF is located, then the BGCF shall select a MGCF that will be responsible for the interworking with the PSTN/CS Domain. If the routing determination results in break out in another network, the BGCF will forward this session signalling to another BGCF in the selected network. If the routing determination results in the session being destined for another IMS network, the BGCF forwards the message to an ICSCF in this IMS network. Any remaining non-MPS voice sessions in PS may be released. Any remaining MPS sessions, e.g., MPS data, in PS shall not be released.\n\n5.10\tInterworking with CS domain\n\n5.10.1\tMobile origination in the CS domain -> MPS mobile termination\n\nFor a Priority Service voice call, as described in [2] and as specified in [3, 4, 5], originated by a Service User in the CS Domain, MPS shall support priority Mobile Termination of the session in the IMS. The priority information received from the CS domain shall be mapped and used in the IMS accordingly. This does not mean that 3GPP terminals must support fixed access, nor does it mean that fixed terminals must support 3GPP access.\n\nThe scope includes maintaining backward compatibility in order to ensure seamless inter-working with existing services available in the CS domain, such as CS speech and video telephony, as well as with terminals of earlier 3GPP releases. In addition, inter-working with other IMS and non-IMS IP networks as well as traditional PSTN is covered.\n\nThe client may also support the IMS Messaging service and Group 3 facsimile transmission. The scope therefore also includes media handling for non-conversational media using MSRP and UDPTL-based Facsimile over IP (FoIP). 13.2\tIMS interworking Model\n\n13.2.1\tIntroduction\n\nThe signalling interface between the UE and the P-CSCF is a logical interface, i.e. it uses 5GC as a QoS flow. The Npcf_SMPolicyControl services, offered via N7 interface, are used for network communication between the SMF and the PCF. For a description of the IMS architecture, refer to 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.228\u00a0[12].\n\n13.2.2\tIMS specific configuration in the SMF\n\nThe SMF shall have a list of preconfigured addresses of signalling servers (the P-CSCF servers)."

The RAN assistance parameters may include E-UTRAN signal strength thresholds, WLAN channel utilization thresholds, WLAN backhaul data rate thresholds, WLAN signal strength thresholds and Offload Preference Indicator (OPI). 2.\tThe AMF sends the Inactive Assistance Information to the NG-RAN. The eDRX parameters in CM-IDLE state are included as defined in clause\u00a05.3.3.2.5 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[2].\n\n3.\tBefore transitioning the UE into RRC_Inactive state, NG-RAN determines the eDRX parameters for UE in RRC_Inactive state.\n\n4.\tIf the eDRX cycle in RRC_Inactive state is larger than 10.24s, NG-RAN may send the N2 message to inform the AMF that UE is entering RRC_Inactive state to enable CN buffering. -\tRAN anchor node configures the UE with eDRX value and PTW to be used during RRC-Inactive when releasing the UE to RRC-Inactive.\n\n-\tThe CM idle mode eDRX and PTW configuration are provided to NG-RAN in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information as described in TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[2] and TS\u00a038.413\u00a0[6].\n\n-\tRAN is responsible for paging and will apply RAN paging strategy considering the UE PTW configuration.\n\n-\tRAN either buffers MT data if it finds it feasible or triggers the UE context release (N2 msg). So in addition to \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\", the QoS parameters, e.g. PER and ARP in the 5QI of MBS QoS flow can be used by NG-RAN to determine whether the MBS session can be sent to RRC Inactive state to receives the multicast MBS session data.\n\nNOTE\u00a02:\tThe QoS parameters of MBS QoS flow is received by NG-RAN from MB-SMF during establishment of shared delivery.\n\nTo support differentiate the UEs involving in one multicast MBS sessions, the same mechanism can be used. The Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service is used to assist NG RAN to perform RAN based paging.\n\nRRC_INACTIVE state is part of RRC state machine, and it is up to the RAN to determine the conditions to enter RRC_INACTIVE state. If any of the parameters included in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information changes as the result of NAS procedure, the AMF shall update the RRC Inactive Assistance Information to the NG-RAN node.\n\nWhen the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, if the AMF has provided RRC Inactive assistance information, the RAN node may decide to move a UE to CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE state."

Figure 5.5.6.1-1: Location measurement indication\n\nThe purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR which require measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards E-UTRA (eutra-FineTimingDetection) which requires measurement gaps.

The actual requirements are added to the corresponding technical specifications.\n\nThe purpose of this WI on High power UE (power class 2) for EN-DC (1 LTE TDD band + 1 NR TDD band) is to improve the UP coverage of 5G UE. The work item of UE power saving in NR includes the power saving techniques, such as DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation in CONNECTED state, fast transition out of CONNECTED state, and reduced RRM measurements in idle/inactive states. The UE assistance information is part of the work to enable the UE to feedback its preferred configuration to achieve desired power saving. \n\nThe UE power saving work in Rel-16 focuses on the power saving techniques in CONNECTED state, which includes DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of CONNECTED state."

UE can be indicated to skip PDCCH monitoring for a duration, starting from next slot after the indication, and shall resume PDCCH monitoring after the indicated duration. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 skipping durations. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\n\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain. Therefore, UE power saving scheme would benefit from application awareness in the form of additional information either carried over the user plane or new assistance information delivered using the control plane. UE power saving may also be achieved through PDCCH monitoring adaptation mechanisms when configured by the network, including skipping of PDCCH monitoring and Search space set group (SSSG) switching. In this case UE does not monitor PDCCH during the PDCCH skipping duration except for the cases as specified in TS 38.213 [38], or monitors PDCCH according to the search space sets applied in SSSG. In 5G radio systems, users in connected mode keep monitoring the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH), which carries scheduling grants transmitted by gNB. This continuous monitoring of the PDCCH forces users to stay in active mode even when there is no traffic to be scheduled, thus resulting in unnecessary power consumption. To mitigate this problem, 5G defines UE power saving schemes including Connected mode DRX (CDRX) and PDCCH monitoring adaptation (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Accordingly, the following new functionalities are developed and supported for NR:\n\n\u2022\tEnhancements for idle/inactive-mode UE power saving: Paging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode and Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected mode to idle/inactive-mode UEs\n\n\u2022\tEnhancements for connected-mode UE power saving: Further PDCCH monitoring reduction, including enhanced search space set group (SSSG) switching and PDCCH skipping and Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected mode\n\nPaging enhancements to reduce UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode\n\nIn order to reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, Once configured by the network, the UE can autonomously deny NR UL transmission. Otherwise, the UE shall not perform any NR UL autonomous denials for IDC.\n\n11\tUE Power Saving\n\nThe PDCCH monitoring activity of the UE in RRC connected mode is governed by DRX, BA, DCP and cell DTX (see clause 15.4.2.3).\n\nWhen DRX is configured, the UE does not have to continuously monitor PDCCH. DRX is characterized by the following:\n\n-\ton-duration: duration that the UE waits for, after waking up, to receive PDCCHs. If DRX is configured and the DRX group of the serving cell enters outside Active Time, the UE terminates PDCCH skipping for the serving cell.\n\nIf the UE changes to a new active DL BWP of the serving cell by the expiration of bwp-InactivityTimer or by RRC configuration, the UE \n\n-\tresumes PDCCH monitoring according to the search space sets on the new active BWP of the serving cell when UE is in a PDCCH skipping duration, if the UE is not provided searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 on the new active DL BWP\n\n-\tmonitors PDCCH according to search space sets with group index 0 on the new active BWP of the serving cell, if the UE is provided searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17."

If V2X application layer of the UE indicates the mode of communication to V2X layer, the V2X layer shall set the mode of communication based on the request of the V2X application layer; otherwise, the V2X layer sets the mode of communication based on the mapping information for a V2X service type defined in clause\u00a05.1.2.1.

The V2X layer passes the PC5 QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer. The source Layer-2 IDs may differ between different communication modes.\n\nWhen IP-based V2X communication is supported for broadcast and groupcast modes of V2X communication over PC5 reference point, the source IP address is allocated as described in clause\u00a05.2.1.5.\n\nIf the UE has an active V2X application that requires privacy support in the current Geographical Area, as identified by configuration described in clause\u00a05.1.2.1, in order to ensure that a source UE (e.g. vehicle) cannot be tracked or identified by any other UEs (e.g. A UE may use either type of PC5 or both for V2X communication depending on the services the UE supports.

This procedure is applicable when the target UE is able to determine its location.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.16.3-1: Reporting of Location Events to an LCS Client or AF via user plane\n\n1. For periodic location reporting, the LCS Service Request may include a scheduled location time for the first periodic location report. For area event reporting, the LCS Service Request includes details of the target geographical area, an indication to have an additional check whether UE is located within the requested target area, whether the event to be reported is the UE being inside, entering into or leaving the target area, the duration of event reporting, the minimum and maximum time intervals between successive event reports, the maximum event sampling interval, whether location estimates shall be included in event reports (and associated location QoS), and whether only one location report is required or more than one. to detect if area event reporting may have been aborted due to UE power off).\n\nNOTE:\tTo achieve more precise usage of area event in some scenario, e.g. for small target area, it may be useful if LCS Client/AF requests UE location estimate and compares the location estimate with the target area.\n\nc)\tPeriodic Location: An event where a defined periodic timer expires in the UE and activates a location report. If a periodic event is detected by the UE but an event report cannot be sent (e.g. because the UE cannot access the network temporarily), a report shall be sent later when possible and the periodic timer for the next event shall then be started.

The H-GMLC verifies that both the target UE and the LCS Client or AF are subscribed to user plane reporting. Figure 6.3.1-1: Deferred 5GC-MT-LR for periodic, triggered and UE available location events\n\n1.\tThe external location services client, the NF or the AF (via NEF) sends a request to the (H)GMLC for location reporting for periodic, triggered or UE available location events. The request is sent as described for step\u00a01 in clause\u00a06.1.2 with the differences described here. The LCS Service Request provides the type of periodic or triggered location reporting being requested and associated parameters. For periodic location, the LCS Service Request includes the time interval between successive location reports, the total number of reports and may include location QoS. The main principles of this solution are as follows:\n\n1.\tThe solution applies to event reporting for a periodic or triggered deferred 5GC-MT-LR.\n\n2.\tThe target UE uses a user plane connection to report events to the LCS Client or AF, either directly or via the LMF or H-GMLC.\n\n3.\tWhen reporting directly to the LCS Client or AF or reporting via an H-GMLC, the UE sends a supplementary services event report (e.g. as defined in TS\u00a024.080\u00a0[21]) over the user plane connection with a location estimate included."

The 5G network shall provide a mechanism to expose broadcasting capabilities to trusted third-party broadcasters' management systems.\n\nBased on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to manage this trusted third-party owned application(s) in the operator's Service Hosting Environment.\n\nBased on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a third-party to monitor this trusted third-party owned application(s) in the operator's Service Hosting Environment.\n\nBased on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to scale a network slice used for the third-party, i.e. to adapt its capacity. The UEs using App2 are served with NSy over UFB1. \n\n5.11.5\tExisting features partly or fully covering the use case functionality\n\nFollowing are existing requirements specified in TS 22.261 [2]:\n\n-\tBased on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to manage this trusted third-party owned application(s) in the operator's Service Hosting Environment.\n\n-\tBased on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party to scale a network slice used for the third-party, i.e. to adapt its capacity. to adapt its capacity.\n\nBased on operator policy, a 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow one type of traffic (from trusted third-party owned applications in the operator's Service Hosting Environment) to/from a UE to be offloaded to a Service Hosting Environment close to the UE's location. \n\nBased on operator policy, the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted third-party application to request appropriate QoE from the network. \n\nBased on operator policy, the 5G network shall expose a suitable API to an authorized third-party to provide the information regarding the availability status of a geographic location that is associated with that third-party. This solution enables the trusted third-party AF to provide application policy information to the operator's Service Hosting Environment. This solution also enables automatic management of application resources.\n\n6.9.1.2\tNetwork slice quota management capability exposure\n\nFigure 6.9.1.2-1 illustrates the network slice quota management process to address the key issue 10 for managing trusted third-party owned application(s).\n\nPre-conditions:\n\n1.\tThe network slice enabler layer is capable to interact with NEF.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9.1.2-1: Network slice quota management process\n\n1.\tThe VAL server initiates network slice quota management request towards the NSCE server. The dashed lines between visited hosting network operator and Home network operators are based on service level e-agreement and the horizontal line represents the demarcation between the network operator domains and the 3rd party domain. In an operator network, the application layer entities include IMS network, Application platforms, and API Gateway for third party applications developed using APIs (e.g. REST, GSMA OneAPI). \n\nFigure A-1 provides the home-routed roaming scenario for collaborative scenarios where traffic is routed to home network operator and applications are delivered by the home operator owned IMS or Application platform via roaming agreements between network operators. In particular, this KI will address:\n\n-\tWhether and how the AF can provide application policy information to the operator's Service Hosting Environment to enable automatic management of application resources?\n\n-\tWhat application policy information needs to be specified by the trusted third-party AF that can be automatically evaluated by the operator's Service Hosting Environment? \n\n-\tWhether and how the AF can manage use of the application resources in the operator's Service Hosting Environment on a per user characteristic?"

        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "5.19.3\tAMF Load Balancing\n\nThe AMF Load Balancing functionality permits UEs that are entering into an AMF Region/AMF Set to be directed to an appropriate AMF in a manner that achieves load balancing between AMFs. This is achieved by setting a Weight Factor for each AMF, such that the probability of the 5G-AN selecting an AMF is proportional to Weight Factor of the AMF. The Weight Factor is typically set according to the capacity of an AMF node relative to other AMF nodes. The Weight Factor is sent from the AMF to the 5G-AN via NGAP messages (see TS\u00a038.413\u00a0[34]). e.g. in a mature network, changes on a monthly basis could be anticipated, e.g. due to the addition of 5G-AN or 5GC nodes.\n\nNOTE\u00a03:\tWeight Factors for AMF Load Balancing are associated with AMF Names.\n\nLoad balancing by 5G-AN node is only performed between AMFs that belong to the same AMF set, i.e. AMFs with the same PLMN, AMF Region ID and AMF Set ID value.\n\nThe 5G-AN node may have their Load Balancing parameters adjusted (e.g. The weight factors are used for load distribution of the initial N2 messages. The AMF chooses whether or not to use the same TNL association for the initial N2 message and subsequent messages for that UE. TNL associations configured with a weight factor set to zero are not permitted for the initial N2 message, but can be used for subsequent N2 messages.\n\nDeployments that rely solely on 5GC-based load balancing can set the weight factors associated with TNL associations that are permitted for the initial N2 message to the same value. The 5G-AN node may have their Load Balancing parameters adjusted (e.g. the Weight Factor is set to zero if all subscribers are to be removed from the AMF, which will route new entrants to other AMFs within an AMF Set).\n\n5.19.4\tAMF Load Re-Balancing\n\nThe AMF load re-balancing functionality permits cross-section of its subscribers that are registered on an AMF (within an AMF Set) to be moved to another AMF within the same AMF set with minimal impacts on the network and end users. AMF selection functionality in the 5G-AN or CP NFs or SCP considers the following factors for selecting an AMF from AMF Set:\n\n-\tAvailability of candidate AMF(s).\n\n-\tLoad balancing across candidate AMF(s) (e.g. considering weight factors of candidate AMFs in the AMF Set).\n\n-\tIn 5G-AN, 5G CIoT features indicated in RRC signalling by the UE.\n\n-\tIn 5G-AN, SNPN Onboarding indication as indicated in 5G-AN signalling by the UE. Deployments that rely solely on 5GC-based load balancing can set the weight factors associated with TNL associations that are permitted for the initial N2 message to the same value.\n\nThe 5G-AN supplies over N2 the AMF with information about the Tracking Area(s) it serves and the S-NSSAI(s) it supports in each of these Tracking Areas. See clause\u00a05.3.2.3 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[2]. The Weight Factor is sent from the AMF to the 5G-AN via NGAP messages (see TS\u00a038.413\u00a0[34]).\n\nNOTE\u00a01:\tAn operator may decide to change the Weight Factor after the establishment of NGAP connectivity as a result of changes in the AMF capacities. e.g. a newly installed AMF may be given a very much higher Weight Factor for an initial period of time making it faster to increase its load.\n\nNOTE\u00a02:\tIt is intended that the Weight Factor is NOT changed frequently. e.g. in a mature network, changes on a monthly basis could be anticipated, e.g."

For example, the ability to communicate mission critical information to groups of users is a common need regardless of service type.

        "explanation": "In a remote interference scenario, victim and aggressor gNBs are grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID.",
        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted.\n\nA remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Such interference is termed as remote interference. A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs may execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells.\n\nTo mitigate remote interference, RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs are specified. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. In both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set can simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.\n\nIn the wireless framework, RIM-RS (RIM reference signal) type 1 and RIM-RS type 2 are specified. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.\n\nTo mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless. In case of split gNB architecture, in the victim set, a gNB-DU detects the remote interference. If remote interference is detected, the gNB-DU can send out the RIM-RS. In the aggressor set, if a gNB-DU detects the RIM-RS sent by the victim gNB(s), it sends to the gNB-CU the RIM-RS detection status and the victim Set ID. The RIM backhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication about the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on the indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference have ceased.\n\nIn both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has disappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference signal.\n\n17.2\tCross-Link Interference Management\n\nWhen different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).

The UE has a preconfigured tunnel to the MNO's network. The UE's user plane tunnel transports both the user plane and control plane traffic of the underground gNB. The UEs that camp on the underground gNB have full 5G service, limited only by the (limited) bandwidth available (and added latency) due to the PLC and UE to gNB links.\n\nA.3\tService Flows\n\nThe power lines in the facility are checked for their suitability for transmission of communications data. Power line communication termination is placed in the radio access station in the roof and the 3GPP access indoor station underground.

RSU is a logical entity that supports V2X application logic using the functionality provided by either a 3GPP network (referred to as an eNB/gNB-type RSU) or a UE (referred to as UE-type RSU).\n\nSince an RSU is essentially only different from a eNB/gNB or UE in terms of its deployment nature, e.g. it may be deployed by a national roads authority instead of an MNO, there is no specification of features particular to RSUs. They operate simply according to sidelink or UL/DL specifications as appropriate. \n\n\n\n\nAnnex A:\nChange history In current 3GPP standards, it has been a design choice to allow RRC UECapabilityEnquiry and RRC UECapabilityInformations messages to be sent unprotected \"before\" AS security activation. The reason for allowing that is to enable the network to do early optimization for better service/connectivity. It means that during the RRC connection, the gNB in theory could send UECapabilityEnquiry to ask for UE's AS capability, and UE would then send UECapabilityInformation to gNB before AS SMC procedure. The false base station could behave as a man-in-the-middle and catch the UECapabilityInformation over-the-air."

The supplied charging information shall be provided as a rate of communication service (e.g. costs per minute) or as a cumulative charge incurred so far for the communication (i.e. charges recorded from the start of the communication and until the moment the charging information is sent to the served user), or as charging units. Barring services and possibly other supplementary services settings of the IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem) multimedia telephony service may be sensitive information. The subscriber may wish to protect the service setting so that the user (which can be different from the subscriber) cannot change the service setting. This work item introduces password protection for activation of supplementary services in IMS as is available for Circuit Switched (CS) telephony supplementary services defined on TS 22.030.\n\n\n\nThis WI provides the following functionalities:\n\n\n\n\tXML Configuration Access Protocol (XCAP) procedures to protect service configuration by a password, including:\n\n\n\n\tpassword change procedure; and\n\n\n\n\tformat to include the current password in the SIP URI in the XCAP User Identity; The following supplementary services apply. The impact on the supplementary services in case the VCC is executed for the calling party, the called party, or both is described below.\n\n21.2.1\tLine Identification Services\n\nA user who has subscribed to the CLIP Supplementary Service and receives a call shall also receive the line identity or appropriate IMS information of the calling party.\n\nThe identity presentation is not changed for the duration of the call regardless of whether the call undergoes VCC.\n\nIf the CLIR Supplementary Service or IMS identity restriction is applicable to the call, then at call setup time the called user shall receive an indication that the identity is not available because of restriction. certain teleservices and supplementary services via CS or Multimedia Telephony and supplementary services via IMS. Especially for the supplementary services given below a strong relationship exists from the user's point of view. Therefore means shall be provided to enable a consistent user experience when changing from one service domain to the other.\n\nThe requirements in this clause are applicable during the migration to an ICS. The ability to synchronise the service settings will facilitate the migration from a CS to an IMS based network and will allow network operators maximum flexibility in their migration strategies. If the resources are not reused by destination B within this time, the network will automatically recall user A.\n\nWhen user A accepts the CC recall, then the network will automatically generate a CC call to destination B.\n\nThe CCNL supplementary service enables user A, encountering a destination B which is not registered with the IMS network (Not Logged-in), to have the communication completed without the user having to manually initiate a new communication attempt when the destination becomes logged in.\n\nWhen user A encounters a destination B which is not registered with the IMS network (Not Logged-in), user A can request the CCNL supplementary service.\n\nWhen user A requests the CCNL supplementary service, the network will monitor for destination B becoming registered. With regard to supplementary services, the general principle is that CS-based supplementary services only apply whilst a VCC subscriber is in the CS domain and equivalent services over IMS only apply whilst a VCC subscriber is in the IMS domain, although there are exceptions listed below. It is not required to synchronise the supplementary service settings of the CS domain with the related service settings of the IMS (e.g. different forwarding numbers may apply over CS and over IMS).\n\nThe following supplementary services apply. The impact on the supplementary services in case the VCC is executed for the calling party, the called party, or both is described below."

        "category": "Standards overview",
        "context": "4.6\tNetwork slicing\n\n4.6.1\tGeneral\n\nThe 5GS supports network slicing as described in 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[8]. Within a PLMN or SNPN, a network slice is identified by an S-NSSAI, which is comprised of a slice/service type (SST) and a slice differentiator (SD). Inclusion of an SD in an S-NSSAI is optional. A set of one or more S-NSSAIs is called the NSSAI. Based on literature study, and related standard specification in 3GPP and other SDOs, we can discuss network slicing scenarios from the following perspective.\n\nClause\u00a05.15.2 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[7] describes the identification of network slice using NSSAI, and specifies the following:\n\nAn S-NSSAI identifies a Network Slice.\n\nAn S-NSSAI is comprised of:\n\n-\tA Slice/Service type (SST), which refers to the expected Network Slice behaviour in terms of features and services;\n\n-\tA Slice Differentiator (SD), which is optional information that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of the same Slice/Service type. The network slice capabilities and management options offered to the customer are determined by a business agreement prior to and outside of the scope of 3GPP standards.\n\nThe VAL server can identify the Network slice in Network Slice creation request with the Network Slice indicator (e.g., S-NSSAI). \n\nUpon network slice allocation, the NSCE server acts as the network slice provisioning MnS consumer. The NSCE server requests 'AllocacatedNsi' operation to the network slice provisioning MnS producer as specified in TS 28.531. When the 'AllocatedNsi' operation is received, the network slice provisioning MnS Producer in 5GS performs charging mechanism as specified in TS 28.202. The following paragraphs give a brief summary of the basic concepts of QoS and slicing which are the basis for intent-driven management of network slices. \n\nThe QoS framework (clause 5.7) and network slicing (clause 5.15) are two independent key features of the 3GPP mobile network architecture [6]. According to TS 23.501 [6]:\n\n-\tOne network slice (identified by its S-NSSAI) supports one or more PDU Connectivity Service (\"PDU sessions\u201d) i.e. services that provide exchange of PDUs between a UE and a data network identified by a DNN. 28.4\tInformation for Network Slicing\n\n28.4.1\tGeneral\n\nIn order to identify a Network Slice end to end, the 5GS uses information called S-NSSAI (Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information). See clause\u00a05.15.2 of 3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[119].\n\nAn S-NSSAI is comprised of:\n\n-\tA Slice/Service type (SST),\n\n-\tA Slice Differentiator (SD), which is optional information that complements the Slice/Service type(s) to differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices. From a BSS perspective no gaps in 3GPP specifications have been identified\n\n5.5\tExposure of network slice as a service\n\n5.5.1\tDescription\n\n5.5.1.0\tGeneral\n\nThis use case involves the following roles:\n\n- NSP: Network Slice Provider\n\n- NSC: Network Slice Customer\n\n- NOP: Network Operator\n\n- CSC: Communication Service Customer\n\n- CSP: Communication Service Provider\n\n, and the following systems:\n\n- BSS: Business Support System\n\n- OSS: Operations Support System, made up of the two following sub-systems:\n\n- SML: Service Management Layer\n\n- NML: Network Management Layer (for sake of simplicity, GroupId\n\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.571\u00a0[16]\n\nIdentifies a group of UEs.\n\n\n\nSnssai\n\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.571\u00a0[16]\n\nIdentifies a Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information.\n\n\n\nSupportedFeatures\n\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.571\u00a0[16]\n\nIndicates the features supported.\n\n\n\nUri\n\n3GPP\u00a0TS\u00a029.571\u00a0[16]\n\nContains a URI."

In support of external services provided behind an eRG in CPN, this use case describes the enhancement of functionalities and provides the potential service requirements in addition to those described in [11]. \n\n5.22.2\tPre-conditions\n\nDora is a subscriber of network operator Cannon-Beach where she has a user account and subscriptions for her UE and the eRG in the CPN. Based on the subscriptions for the eRG, operator Cannon-Beach enables a strong user authentication mechanism at the 5G system to ensure that the users accessing to the eRG in the CPN are authenticated and authorized. He has obtained the eRG from the operator and now connects it to the fixed access line.\n\nThe fixed operator has arranged that various setting in the eRG are automatically configured (e.g. using TR-069 management).\n\nThe eRG also enables Joe to configure a username / password combination that Joe can use for configuration / management of settings that are not under operator control from any device within the CPN. With this username / password, Joe is now Authorized Administrator for the eRG. \n\nThe public network operator also provides a service where Joe as Authorized Administrator can manage his eRG via a webpage (Ut interface) provided by the operator. Great aspect of this webpage is that the operator provides help with configuration.

A user can receive such a service either outdoor or at home.\n\nThe MNO wants to keep the benefits of multicast/broadcast distribution for in-home access. When at home, the user device (Smartphone, TV set, STB, PC, tablet\u2026) can receive the service through the eRG. The device may be a 3GPP UE connected via a PRAS or the CPN access (e.g. Wi-Fi), or a non-3GPP device connected via the CPN access.\n\n5.20.2\tPre-conditions\n\nTo enable this use case, following pre-conditions should be met:\n\nThe eRG is 5G multicast/broadcast capable.\n\nThe user is at home. CPNs and PINs have in common that in general they are owned, installed and/or (at least partially) configured by a customer of a public network operator. \n\nA Customer Premises Network (CPN) is a network located within a premises (e.g. a residence, office or shop). Via an evolved Residential Gateway (eRG), the CPN provides connectivity to the 5G network. The eRG can be connected to the 5G core network via wireline, wireless, or hybrid access. A Premises Radio Access Station (PRAS) is a base station installed in a CPN. media server, printer, smart thermostat, smart sprinkler, smart blinds, smart garage, etc. These IoT devices or non-3GPP devices authorized to communicate with each other directly or via the eRG are regarded in a Customer Premises Network (CPN).\n\nEditor's Note: this use case assumes that evolved residential gateway (eRG) defined in 3GPP\u00a0TR\u00a022.858\u00a0[6] can operate as a PIN Element with Gateway Capability, which needs further clarification between two studies."

The same principle applies to uplink SPS for LTE-Uu based V2X and sidelink SPS for PC5 based V2X. Work item on \"RAN aspects of LTE-based V2X Services (LTE_V2X)\" started to further enhance LTE for better V2X services. This work specifies enhancements required to enable V2X services with LTE uplink and downlink, to enable LTE PC5 interface using sidelink to support additional V2X services such as V2P (Vehicle-to-Pedestrian), and to support more operational scenarios for V2V services using LTE sidelink. To be specific, RAN groups considered the following as the main features:\n\n\n\n\tUplink and sidelink enhancement to enable eNB to quickly change SPS (Semi-Persistent Scheduling) in adaptation to a change in the V2X message generation pattern Enhancement to sidelink synchronization for operation outside GNSS or eNB coverage\n\n\n\n\tSupport of simultaneous V2X operations over multiple carriers\n\n\n\nAs a result, the LTE radio standard supports the two LTE V2X communication methods illustrated in Figure 1. A summary of the key functionalities made by RAN WG1, RAN WG2, RAN WG3 and RAN WG4 is as below and last status report for the work item on \"RAN aspects of LTE-based V2X Services (LTE_V2X)\" can be found in RP-170236 [15].\n\n\n\n\tUplink and sidelink SPS enhancements information.

However, the outcome as a result of the work item has the limitation that LTE-Uu interface using uplink/downlink was not utilized and only V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) services were considered in a limited operation scenario (e.g., use of only a single carrier in Band 47, only GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) as synchronization source outside eNB coverage, etc.). This support forms Phase 1 of 3GPP's ongoing project relating to V2X, and was intended to support a set of requirements sufficient for basic road safety services. Vehicles containing UEs with these features can use the uplink, downlink and sidelink to exchange information on their own status, such as position, speed, and heading with other nearby vehicles, infrastructure nodes, and pedestrians. Phase 2 of the V2X project was standardised in Release 15, and adds a number of new features to the sidelink intended to enhance efficiency and exploit developments in UE and network designs. These enhancements include sidelink carrier aggregation, higher-order modulation, and reduced latency.

Note that this implies a very high reliability. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which can be outside the 5G system, and data processing. motion control, process automation, etc.) in vertical domains, which require very high levels of communication service availability and/or very low end-to-end latencies. \n\nNPN scenarios bring very specific requirements with regards to SLA fulfilment (e.g., much more stringent KPIs to be fulfilled) and assurance (e.g., different granularity in reporting, much quicker reaction to remediate SLS deviations). Therefore, the 3GPP management system for NPN needs to be provisioned with appropriate capabilities to fulfil these requirements. For services to an airplane, a bitrate of 1,2 Gbps is expected per plane.\n\n-\tCritical Communications (CC) and Ultra Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC): Several scenarios require the support of very low latency and very high communications service availability. These are driven by the new services such as industrial automation. The overall service latency depends on the delay on the radio interface, transmission within the 5G system, transmission to a server which may be outside the 5G system, and data processing. refineries and water distribution networks. Process automation is characterized by high requirements on the communications system regarding communication service availability. Systems supporting process automation are usually deployed in geographically limited areas, access to them is usually limited to authorized users, and it will usually be served by non-public networks. \n\n-\tAutomation for electricity distribution and smart grid (mainly medium and high voltage). Electricity distribution and smart grid are is characterized by high requirements on the communications service availability and security, as well as low latency in some cases. In contrast to the above use cases, electricity distribution and smart grid are deeply immersed into the public space. Note 6: Performance requirements for all the values in this table should be analyzed independently for each scenario. \n\n7.5\tHigh-availability IoT traffic\n\n7.5.1\tDescription\n\nSeveral scenarios require the support of highly reliable machine type communication such as those, typically (but not restricted to) related to medical monitoring. They involve different deployment areas, different device speeds and densities and require a high-availability communication service to transfer a low data rate uplink data stream from one or several devices to an application.\n\nTheir related performance requirements can be found in table 7.5.2-1. Note that the communication service reliability requirement has no direct relationship with the communication service availability requirement.\n\nThe \"# of UEs\" in the tables in clauses 5.2 to 5.5 is intended to give an indication of the UE density that would need to be served within a given service area.\n\nClock synchronisation is needed in many \"vertical\" use cases.

Each item in the IT system is identified and has a controlled configuration that can be verified and audited. This allows other processes to be automated and the complete IT status to be taken into consideration in real-time, e.g. Timely recognition of any degradation and continuous self-diagnosis of components are used to support and plan maintenance.

MPS for Data Transport Service (DTS) is a generic priority packet transport service that applies independently of the specific data application being used. In the case of EPS, MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the default bearer upon request. It may also apply to other bearers based on operator policy and regulatory rules. In the case of 5GS, MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule upon request. It may also apply to other QoS flows based on operator policy and regulatory rules. MPS for DTS is a specific example of Priority Data Bearer Service. Each IP traffic filter may identify traffic based on destination address, transport protocol, destination/source port numbers, DSCP or Traffic Class, destination domain name and application identity.\n\nThe prioritised list of access technologies included in the rules for IFOM and MAPCON may contain 3GPP access, WLAN access as well as specific 3GPP RATs such as GERAN, UTRAN and E-UTRAN. The order of the access technologies in this list allows the operator to prioritize specific 3GPP RATs with respect to WLAN access. The UE shall use the prioritised list of access technologies in these rules only for IP routing and PDN connection establishment. MPS for Data Transport Service enables the prioritization of all traffic on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows upon AF request. The QoS modification to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows is done based on operator policy and regulatory rules by means of local PCF configuration.\n\nNOTE\u00a02:\tIf no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service applies only to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.\n\nUpon receipt of an MPS for Data Transport Service invocation/revocation request from the UE, the AF or the PCF authorizes the request."
