The capability applied to each individual carrier in a block is agnostic to the order in which they are signalled in the corresponding FS.

When responding, the UE can skip a subset of the requested band combinations when the corresponding UE capabilities are the same. If this capability is included in an \"Intra-band contiguous (NG)EN-DC combination supporting both UL and DL intra-band (NG)EN-DC parts with additional inter-band NR/LTE CA component\", this capability applies to the intra-band (NG)EN-DC BC part.\n\nBC\n\nNo\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n\n\n4.2.7.10\tPhy-Parameters\n\nDefinitions for parameters\n\nPer\n\nM\n\nFDD-TDD\n\nDIFF\n\nFR1-FR2\n\nDIFF\n\nabsoluteTPC-Command\n\nIndicates whether the UE supports absolute TPC command mode."

This measurement is usefule to optimize DL/UL subframe pattern through the SRS-RSRP distribution and to mitigate CLI. \u2022\tCorresponding OAM functions to support RIM operation is identified.\n\n\n\nCLI handling\n\nOnce different TDD UL/DL configurations are applied among neighboring cells, UL transmission from a UE in a cell causes interference to DL reception of some other UEs in the rest of the neighboring cells. The interference is referred as inter-cell UE-to-UE cross link interference (CLI). To mitigate an inter-cell UE-to-UE CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate the intended TDD UL/DL configuration over Xn and F1 interfaces. Taking into account the exchanged information, a gNB may decide the transmission and reception pattern in order to avoid CLI to neighboring cell or from neighboring cell. A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted."

This solution provides a UE Negotiation-Based mechanism for the direct communication path switching between PC5 to Uu reference points.

A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor cells, where the gNBs may execute Remote Interference Management (RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells.\n\nTo mitigate remote interference, RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs are specified. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. In both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set can simultaneously transmit an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.\n\nIn the wireless framework, RIM-RS (RIM reference signal) type 1 and RIM-RS type 2 are specified. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.\n\nTo mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless. In the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal (RIM-RS type 1) from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measurement, establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul messages which carry the detection or disappearance indication are aggregated at gNB-CU via F1 interface and sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim gNBs via NG interface, where the signalling is transparent to the core network."

        "category": "Standards overview",
        "context": "More details can be found in [1], clause 5.32.5.\n\n-\tLoad-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages: This introduces enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. It is quite challenging to steer the traffic in a balanced distribution so that the network performance could be assured. Load balancing had been proposed to address the issue. The objective of load balancing is to distribute load evenly among cells and among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cells or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one cell, cell area, carrier or RAT to improve network performance. This can be done by means of optimization of handover parameters and handover actions. AI/ML capabilities, e.g. When a threshold value is provided, the \"REDUNDANT\" steering mode is only used for Non-GBR SDF.\n\nb.\twhen the access traffic steering mode in the \"steerModeValue\" attribute is \"LOAD_BALANCING\", the PCF may provide within the \"steerModeInd\" attribute:\n\n-\t\"AUTO_LOAD_BALANCE\", when the UE and UPF are allowed to autonomously determine the traffic load of an SDF distributed across accesses; or\n\n-\t\"UE_ASSISTANCE\", when the UE is allowed to decide how to distribute the UL traffic of an SDF and the UE may inform the UPF how it decided to distribute the UL traffic."

For that, two procedures have been introduced. For that, two procedures have been introduced. The first one is the MBMS bearer coordination independent on broadcasted media procedure to be used when there are multiple MC service servers serving users in one specific area covered with one MBMS bearer, but the servers broadcast media independent of each other. The second procedure is the MBMS bearer coordination within one group call. This one is used when multiple MC service servers of the same kind participate in the same group communication. The MC service servers could be different MC service servers assigned the participating role within one MC system. This feature is specified in 3GPP TS 23.280. An MC service server controlling the MBMS bearer has the MBMS bearer control role. Different MC service servers may allocate bearers as needed and make them available for other MC service servers to use. The use of the procedure in this sub clause is optional.

The solutions that have been specified include:\n\n-\tSemi-static CFI configuration\n\n-\tPDSCH repetition\n\n-\tUL SPS repetition\n\n-\tPDCP packet duplication\n\n-\tGranular time reference provision.\n\nThese solutions support configurable reliability and latency combinations and have been specified on top of the existing LTE air interface for Frame Structure type 1 (FS1) and Frame Structure type 2 (FS2), including various LTE TTI lengths (1ms, slot and subslot for FS1, 1ms and slot for FS2) as well as existing LTE latency reduction techniques. The number of TBs is dynamically controlled by the DCI. The TBs can be configured to be transmitted consecutively or subframe interleaved (in case of subframe repetition). For PDSCH multi-TB scheduling, HARQ-ACK bundling can optionally be used to improve the resource utilization further for UEs in good coverage. For PUSCH multi-TB scheduling, early termination of the PUSCH transmission is supported through indication of positive HARQ-ACK in the DCI."

In online charging, network resource usage is granted by the OCS based on a subscriber account on the OCS.

Furthermore, after waking up from LP-WUS, either all UEs could be triggered to wake up to monitor paging in associated PO(s), or just a subset of the UEs sharing the PO, so called LP-WUS UE subgrouping. The latter can be used to reduce the negative impact from false paging, i.e., unnecessary energy consumption in the UE caused by paging intended for another UE. In the latter case, LP-WUS UE subgrouping information corresponding to 2 bits or more, would be indicated by LP-WUS. How to indicate the subgrouping information, e.g."

SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and can be initiated either by the UE in case of MO-SDT (Mobile Originated SDT) or by the network in case of MT-SDT (Mobile Terminated SDT). Small data transmission procedures have been defined in 3GPP Rel-17 for SDT-RA for both two step and four step RA during RRC Inactive with a view of providing power saving opportunities and reducing overhead signalling. Without well performing UE beam correspondence support, wide usage of RRC_INACTIVE and Small Data Transmission may not be feasible in practical FR2 deployments.

The RRM measurement reductions are the power saving techniques specified in idle/inactive states.UE assistance information is supported for the UE to feedback its preferred configuration of the specific power saving technique.\n\nPower Saving Techniques in CONNECTED state\n\nThe power saving techniques are dynamically triggered by L1 signaling indicated from PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel or semi-statically configured by RRC signaling.The PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel reuses the existing PDCCH search space and CORESET configurations with dynamic TCI states with DCI field indicating the adaptation to achieve UE power saving, such as UE wakeup in the DRX operation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation through BWP switching. Both Rel-16 DCP and Rel-17 PDCCH monitor adaptation are both PDCCH based signalling. For a UE equipped with LR, the MR can be in a sleep state while the LR remains active to monitor Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS), and when LP-WUS is received by LR, it will trigger the MR to wake up to monitor PDCCH. As LR would adopt a minimalistic design, the power consumption of LR is expected to be significantly lower than legacy PDCCH based signaling using the main receiver (MR) in some cases."

        "context": "Therefore, during LTE HO, WLAN transmission and reception can continue. To support this functionality, a new procedure referred to as \"Handover without WT change\" has been defined. In this procedure, during the handover, the target eNB initiates the WT Addition procedure (to the same WT the UE is associated with) and the source eNB may postpone the WT Release Request, so that the data may be sent/received via WLAN during the HO. If dropped, only the colliding SPS PUSCH transmission is dropped, while the remaining PUSCH transmissions within the transmission window are performed.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2-2: UL SPS repetition on one SPS configuration\n\nIn case of new data arrival, a UE has to wait for the next first (s)TTI of the transmission window before being able to transmit new data (as depicted in Figure 2). With a single UL SPS configuration, this induces a maximum delay of P (s)TTIs. To shorten this delay, the specifications allow multiple SPS configurations for the same TTI length to be activated on the same serving cell. Even though the radio access and the core network signalling in principle supports up to 11 bearers, the UE capability was limited only to 8 data bearers. Since LTE Rel-8 operators have launched a number of new services, and it has become more and more evident that more than 8 radio bearers will be needed to support simultaneously all the services. Without this extension there can be risk of inconsistent end user service behaviour that will ultimately prevent adding further QoS based services for a UE. It also worth noting that LTE Rel-8 has a restriction of having 8 AM bearers or 5AM+3 UM data bearers, which limits further availability for emerging differentiated data services."

In some implementations, timing resiliency enhancements to the 5G system can work in collaboration with different types of time sources (e.g., atomic clock, time service delivered over the fibre) to provide a robust time synchronization.\n\n5G as a consumer of time synchronization benefits from timing resiliency which enables the support of many critical services within the 5G network even during the event of a loss or degradation of the primary GNSS reference timing. Additionally, for time critical services (e.g. In this use case, the smart grid is subscribed to and authorized to use the 5G timing resiliency service to ensure reliable timing signals are always available. The 5G timing resiliency service monitors the accuracy and availability of timing signals from a designated timing source and is able to provide an alternate source (e.g., 5G holdover capacity, atomic clock) in case of failure in the primary source.

Regarding higher accuracy, two promising techniques identified in earlier studies will be considered in Release 18: one is to take the advantage of the rich 5G spectrum to increase the bandwidth for the transmission and reception of the positioning reference signals based on PRS/SRS bandwidth aggregation for intra-band carriers, and the other is to use the NR carrier phase measurements. GNSS carrier phase positioning has been used very successfully for centimetre-level positioning but is limited to outdoor applications. NR carrier phase positioning has the potential for significant performance improvements for indoor and outdoor deployments in comparison with the existing NR positioning methods, as well as shorter latency and lower UE power consumption in comparison with RTK-GNSS outdoors."

This allows small slices of non-LTE spectrum to be used as a standalone NB-IoT carrier and be linked with NB-IoT carriers associated to LTE spectrum.\n\nPower headroom reporting enhancement (FDD)\n\nIn Rel-13, power headroom reports (PHR) are made by the UE from one of two tables depending on coverage, each containing four entries. This feature improves the granularity of PHR transmitted in Msg3 to have 16 levels. Among the specific features of these DCI formats, resource allocation has been modified to reflect the shorter TTI and therefore the granularity in RB allocation is increased.\n\nAdditional functionality also specified in the feature is sTTI specific aperiodic CSI reporting which includes measuring on a slot/subslot CSI reference resource as well as faster triggering and faster processing time for the CSI to be reported. Periodic CSI reporting is not supported.\n\nAlso, semi-persistent scheduling is specified for sTTI with similar functionality as in legacy operation. A contention based SPS operation is allowed where different UEs can be assigned different cyclic shifts and IFDMA combs for the DMRS, but fully/partially overlapping resource allocation."

        "context": "Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-180851 revised in RP-181838.\n\nThis work item is a collection of additions and enhancements of functionalities related to NB-IoT, primarily focusing on reducing UE power consumption and on enhancing the parts of the Rel-13/14 NB-IoT air interface and protocol layers to respond to feedback from early deployments.\n\nAdditional new features include support for small cells, extensions to NB-IoT standalone operation mode, and TDD.\n\nWake-up signalling for IDLE mode (FDD)\n\nWhen a UE is in DRX or eDRX, it has to regularly check if a paging message is arriving from the core network. At most possible occasions for paging, no message arrives for the UE and the power the UE consumed could have been saved. This feature allows the eNB to send the UE a 'wake-up signal' (WUS) to instruct the UE that it has to monitor NPDCCH for paging, and otherwise allows the UE to skip the paging procedures. This allows the UE to potentially keep parts of its hardware switched off for more of the time, and save the power of decoding NPDCCH and NPDSCH for paging. Improved DL transmission efficiency and UE power consumption \n\nReduced UE power consumption and improved transmission efficiency are achieved through reduced downlink monitoring and reduced signalling, building on features introduced in earlier releases.\n\nUE-group wake-up signals (GWUS) (FDD): \n\nWith the introduction of Rel-15 wake-up signalling (WUS), UE can skip the paging procedures if the wake-up signal is not detected to save power. This feature (UE-group WUS) allows eNB to transmit a UE-group WUS to instruct the UEs in the group that they must monitor NPDCCH for paging. This allows the UE to skip the paging procedures to save more power if eNB sends UE-group WUS to UEs in other groups."

        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "While the collection of charging information used for the CDRs occurs during the network resource usage, there is no impact of offline charging on the use of the resources. All activities involved in the transformation of the charging information into end user bills, and the collection of the end user charges incurred in these bills, occur offline to, or after, the network resource usage.\n\nThe purpose of online charging is to furnish charging information to the OCS/CCS in order to perform Credit-Control before the network resource usage is permitted. To this end, a prepaid subscriber account has to exist in the OCS/CCS, against which the resource usage can be billed. These network resources may pertain to bearer (e.g. CS, PS), PDU session (e.g. 5GS), subsystem (e.g. IMS sessions) or service (e.g. MMS) usage / consumption. The various charging levels are further described in clause 5.3.\n\nThe purpose of offline charging is to transform the charging information into CDRs that are post-processed within the BD, e.g. for the purpose of generating bills. While the collection of charging information used for the CDRs occurs during the network resource usage, there is no impact of offline charging on the use of the resources. The charging information is then passed through a chain of logical charging functions that are further explained in clause 4.3.1 and clause 4.3.3. At the end of this process, CDR files are generated by the network, which are then transferred to the network operator's BD for the purpose of subscriber billing and/or inter-operator accounting (or additional functions, e.g. statistics, at the operator\u2019s discretion). The BD typically comprises post-processing systems such as the operator's billing system or billing mediation device.\n\nIn conclusion, offline charging is a mechanism where charging information does not affect, in real-time, the service rendered."

Typical activity patterns for which this kind of communication is suitable are event-driven actions.\n\nNon-deterministic communication subsumes all other types of traffic.

Open-loop control is characterised by one or many messages sent to an actuator. These can be sent in a periodic or an aperiodic pattern. However, the communication means used need to be deterministic since typically an activity response from the receiver and/or the receiving application is expected. \n\nClosed-loop control produces both periodic and aperiodic communication patterns."

HARQ-ACK bundling in HD-FDD: In half-duplex FDD operation, the DL peak rate is limited by the fact that the UE needs to switch to UL in order to transmit HARQ-ACK feedback. This work item introduces HARQ-ACK bundling, where the UE transmits a single HARQ-ACK feedback for multiple DL transport blocks, thereby enabling the UE to incease the portion of subframes that can be used for DL data transmission from 30% to 53% (or to 59% using 10 DL HARQ processes).

The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\n\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\n\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. 5GS is already enhanced to support redundant transmission of high reliability communication for URLLC scenario as described in clause\u00a05.33.2 of TS\u00a023.501\u00a0[7]. A UE supporting redundant transmission will set up two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network, and the 5GS sets up the user plane paths of the two redundant PDU Sessions.\n\nFor the multi-path transmission for Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay, the UE acts as a normal UE accessing to its serving NG-RAN directly and also as a Remote UE accessing to NG-RAN through UE-to-Network Relay as shown in Figure 6.39.1-1.

This is achieved by setting a Weight Factor for each AMF, such that the probability of the 5G-AN selecting an AMF is proportional to Weight Factor of the AMF. The Weight Factor is typically set according to the capacity of an AMF node relative to other AMF nodes. The Weight Factor is sent from the AMF to the 5G-AN via NGAP messages (see TS\u00a038.413\u00a0[34])."

Although MUST and the LTE Rel-12 Work Item Network-Assisted Interference Cancellation and Suppression (NAICS) both rely on receivers to perform interference cancellation, the latter targets the inter-cell interference and is typically used when the user is at the cell edge, while the former aims at the intra-cell interference. 5\tConclusions\n\nThis technical report has documented the RAN4 evaluation on techniques to cancel downlink intra cell inter-user interference. The major work includes the determination of network scenario, interference modelling, interference suppressing receiver structure, required information analysis for each candidate receiver, link-level simulation parameters and performance evaluations.\n\nMU-MIMO scenario with gNB transmits PDSCH to the paired UEs through the same time-frequency resources is evaluated.\n\ngNBs equipped with 2Tx and 4Tx antennas are considered in the RAN4 performance evaluation. However, for the UEs capable of inter-user interference suppression ability discussed in this TR, they can also be used in the deployments with larger number of Tx ports configuration. The Work Item on UE requirements for network-based CRS interference enabled a cell to transmit over a reduced bandwidth (6 centre PRBs) when there is no need for its CRS or the network load is not high, which allows to adapt the CRS bandwidth in cells, e.g., to:\n\n-\treduce the interference floor in LTE networks,\n\n-\tfacilitate using higher-order modulation schemes (e.g., 256QAM or above) over larger parts of the radio network coverage,\n\n-\tsave energy in BS,\n\n-\tsave energy in UE capable of network-based CRS interference mitigation which can optimize their DRX operation according to the scenarios specified in TS\u00a036.133, Clause\u00a03.6.1.1."

By authorising a user to register, or a roaming broker to pass that on, each party is in turn authorising charges up to a maximum credit limit with the adjacent party. Any charges levied can then be paid to the adjacent party on a wholesale basis at the end of a mutually agreed accounting period. Funds are thus passed between each party for the services supplied by the network operator in a serial fashion.\n\n\nAnnex A (informative):\nChange history A number of alternative routes may be possible, and ideally the system should be capable of determining the lowest cost to the end user.\n\nTypically, smaller networks will only have a limited number of external connections to other networks or clearing houses, but may not know which one to use for an unknown (new) HE. In this case, the serving network may make a number of inquiries for each route to determine the lowest cost route to handle the call.\n\n8.2\tSettlement of charges\n\nSettlement of charges incurred by a user shall be on a wholesale basis between the different parties involved in the registration link. 7.1\tDelegation of charging authority\n\nThe registration process allows the home environment to authenticate users before they incur any charges. Once authenticated, the home environment then delegates authority to the serving network operator with which he has a direct commercial relationship to incur charges for services supplied to that user. The direct commercial relationship may be with either the serving network operator if known directly by the home environment or a network operator known to the home environment. This procedure uses each network as trusted third parties in a chain of delegation between entities, thus allowing commercial transactions between entities who have no direct commercial dealings. There shall be an authentication procedure between all entities in the 3GPP system which have a commercial relationship."

The  entity may provide (produce) such management services as, for example, the performance management services, configuration management services and fault supervision services.\n\nThe management services can be consumed by another entity, which may in turn produce (expose) the service to other entities. The management services can be consumed by another entity, which may in turn produce (expose) the service to other entities. Figure 5.1.1-1 shows an example of the management service X which is initially produced by the entity A which is an NF , then consumed by another entity B which is a network management function. Then entity B in turn exposes it to the entity C. A.6\tUtilization of management services in functional management architecture\n\nThe management services for a mobile network including network slicing may be produced by a set of functional blocks. This annex shows an example of such deployment scenario where functional blocks (such as NSMF, NSSMF, NFMF and CSMF) are producing and consuming various management services.\n\n\n\nFigure A.6.1: Example of functional management architecture\n\nIn this deployment example:\n\n-\tNFMF (Network Function Management Function) provides the management services for managing one or more NF(s) and may consume some management services produced by other functional blocks."

The analytics conducted and produced by the MDA MnS producer for these two example scenarios would be different and directly affected by the specific status of network. Although the network status (context) affects the produced analytics conducted by the MDA producer, awareness of the network context would fall on the consumer side to complement the obtained analytics results. This network context, reflecting network status at the time of enabling data collection, is important for the MDA MnS consumer to understand the network conditions related to the obtained analytics and hence be able to use such analytics more efficiently. In this case, the MDA MnS consumer may request the MDAS producer to report only high energy consumption issue related analytics results.  When the consumer expects to improve energy efficiency, although it may lead to high energy consumption in network or in certain parts of network, then the related issue is the low energy efficiency one. In that case, the consumer may request analytics results related to low energy efficiency issue. So, the target could be to enhance the performance of NF for a given energy consumption. This will result in higher Energy Efficiency of network.\n\nTo make the energy saving decision, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to determine which Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI related factor(s) (e.g."

The receiving NG-RAN node should act accordingly.\n\nThe solution also builds upon the possibility for an NG-RAN node to page certain UEs (e.g., stationary UEs) in RRC_INACTIVE state on a limited set of beams, instead of paging on all the beams within the cell. 8.4.3\tCell Activation\n\n8.4.3.1\tGeneral\n\nThe purpose of the Cell Activation procedure is to enable an NG-RAN node to request a neighbouring NG-RAN node to switch on all the SSB beams or only some of the SSB beams within one or more cells, previously reported as inactive due to energy saving.\n\nThe procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.\n\n8.4.3.2\tSuccessful Operation\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4.3.2-1: Cell Activation, successful operation\n\nThe NG-RAN node1 initiates the procedure by sending the CELL ACTIVATION REQUEST message to the peer NG-RAN node2."

The authorization of multiple chargeable events as per the \"event based charging\" description in clause 5.1 is not yet covered in the above scenario.\n\nSession based online charging always involves reservation within the Credit-Control procedure (SCUR), as there is no way for the OCS to predict the amount of resource usage that occurs during the user session. To begin with, the CTF forward generates a charging chargeable event that corresponds to the resource usage request and maps onto the user session, and forwards it to the OCF. In the OCS, the online charging session is started and a certain amount reserved from the user subscriber account. The online,offline charging and converged charging can be categorised into two distinct classes, namely event based charging and session based charging. Event based charging implies that a chargeable event is defined as a single end-user-to-network transaction, e.g. the sending of a multimedia message. This chargeable event is then mapped to an appropriate charging event, resulting in a single CDR or in a single Credit-Control and resource usage authorisation procedure. In contrast, session based charging is characterised by the existence of a user session, such as a circuit call, an IP CAN bearer, an PDU session, or an IMS session."

The V3 interface between the UE and the V2X Control Function can be secured in the same way as the PC3 interface between the UE and the ProSe Function, as in TS 33.303 [5]; PSK TLS with GBA (Pre-shared Key Transport Layer Security with Generic Bootstrapping Architecture) is used for UE initiated messages, while PSK TLS including option of GBA push are used for network initiated messages. From this time onward the initiating UE shall use the established link(s) for V2X communication over PC5 and additional PC5 signalling messages to the target UE(s).\n\nAfter receiving the DIRECT LINK ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message, the initiating UE shall provide the following information along with the layer-2 IDs to the lower layer, which enables the lower layer to handle the coming PC5 signalling or traffic data:\n\na)\tthe PC5 link identifier self-assigned for this PC5 unicast link;\n\nb)\tPQFI(s) and its corresponding PC5 QoS parameters; and\n\nc)\tan indication of activation of the PC5 unicast user plane security protection for the PC5 unicast link, if applicable.

This technology revolution is achievable with the introduction of new technologies, both in access and the core, such as flexible, scalable assignment of network resources. In addition to increased flexibility and optimization, a 5G system needs to support stringent KPIs for latency, reliability, throughput, etc. Enhancements in the radio interface contribute to meeting these KPIs as do enhancements in the core network, such as network slicing, in-network caching and hosting services closer to the end points.\n\nA 5G system also supports new business models such as those for IoT and enterprise managed networks. This Feature enhances 5G core network to support ultra-high reliability and low-latency communications (URLLC). The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\n\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\n\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side."

This enables utilization of new functionalities provided by the 5G-CN such as QoS, mobility enhancements and slicing even when using the LTE radio interface.\n\nThe feature \"LTE connectivity to 5G-CN\", or the E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is supported as part of NG-RAN. The E-UTRA can be connected to both EPC and 5GC. However, here, the term \"eNB\" is used for both cases unless there is a specific need to disambiguate between eNB and ng-eNB.\n\nThe LTE connectivity to 5G-CN feature includes the following key functionalities:\n\n-\t5G NAS message transport\n\n-\t5G security framework, except that data integrity protection is not supported;\n\n-\tUnified Access Control\n\n-\tFlow-based QoS\n\n-\tNetwork slicing\n\n-\tSDAP\n\n-\tNR PDCP\n\n-\tSupport of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state.\n\nGenerally, the above functionalities are introduced based on similar functionalities as in NR.

This is known as the NSA architecture, while the 5G AN connected to a 5G CN is called the SA architecture."

However, it is expected that also in the domain of AV content and service production, 3GPP systems will become an important tool for a market sector with steadily growing global revenues. There are several areas in which 3GPP networks can help to produce AV content and services in an efficient and flexible manner.\n\n6.33.2\tRequirements\n\nThe 5G system supports the communication services for video, imaging and audio for professional applications. The associated requirements are described in 3GPP TS 22.263 [28]. Changes in the configuration of the network may also impact the energy utility service provider. Finally, the energy utility service provider can share information with the MNO in order to facilitate rapid diagnosis and recovery from performance problems and energy supply interruptions.\n\nAnother reason that energy utilities are an important sector for 3GPP is that telecommunications network operations themselves require energy. The relationship is bi-directional: MNOs require energy services, and energy utilities require communication services. This demands a particular risk management be undertaken by both systems, especially in the event of an energy outage. fact\n\nis not\t(or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of fact\n\nThe constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe document presents typical media traffic characteristics (including bandwidth and latency requirements) that are of importance for 3GPP standardization work.

This procedure also resets the X2 interface like a Reset procedure would do. The X2 interface was introduced prior to Release 15 to connect two eNBs. In Release 15, it also supports connecting an eNB and en-gNB as to provide NSA. \n\nThe NSA offers dual connectivity, via both the 4G AN (E-UTRA) and the 5G AN (NR). It is thus also called \"EN-DC\", for \"E-UTRAN and NR Dual Connectivity\".\n\nIn EN-DC, the 4G's eNB is the Master Node (MN) while the 5G's en-gNB is the Secondary Node (SN).\n\nThis is explained in detail on the dedicated section on NSA of this present document. 7\tFunctions of X2AP\n\nThe X2AP protocol provides the following functions:\n\n-\tMobility Management. This function allows the eNB to move the responsibility of a certain UE to another eNB. Forwarding of user plane data, Status Transfer and UE Context Release function are parts of the mobility management.\n\n-\tDual Connectivity. This function allows the eNB to request another eNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.\n\n-\tE-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity. This function allows the eNB to request another en-gNB to provide radio resources for a certain UE while keeping responsibility for that UE.\n\n-\tLoad Management."

        "category": "Standards specifications",
        "context": "A signal trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the victim will be impacted. The RIM backhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication about the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on the indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference have ceased.\n\nIn both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has disappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference signal.\n\n17.2\tCross-Link Interference Management\n\nWhen different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI). \u2022\tCorresponding OAM functions to support RIM operation is identified.\n\n\n\nCLI handling\n\nOnce different TDD UL/DL configurations are applied among neighboring cells, UL transmission from a UE in a cell causes interference to DL reception of some other UEs in the rest of the neighboring cells. The interference is referred as inter-cell UE-to-UE cross link interference (CLI). To mitigate an inter-cell UE-to-UE CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate the intended TDD UL/DL configuration over Xn and F1 interfaces. Taking into account the exchanged information, a gNB may decide the transmission and reception pattern in order to avoid CLI to neighboring cell or from neighboring cell."

The gNB provides the UE with the HARQ-ACK feedback timing either dynamically in the DCI or semi-statically in an RRC configuration. A cell periodically broadcasts synchronization signals and SI. These broadcasted messages are intended for all UEs which are camping on a cell. In the idle mode or inactive mode, the UE monitors the SI of cells and choose a suitable cell to camp on. The UE typically acquires the SI from the cell and performs initial access to transition to connected state to obtain services. The system information includes information, among others, like cell (re-)selection parameters, neighbouring cell information, frequency priority, blocklisted cell, common channel configuration information, NAS common information, and public warning system (PWS) messages."

One-time and Continuous Location Reporting are supported for the Current Location. For Continuous Location Reporting, unless a Minimum Reporting Interval was provided, the serving node(s) sends a notification every time it becomes aware of a location change. The granularity depends on the accepted Accuracy. LMF assistance may reduce impacts to UEs - e.g. by allowing an LMF to provide assistance data to the UEs and/or calculate positioning/ranging location results for the UEs.\n\n6.20\tSolution #20: Network assisted Sidelink positioning with scheduled location time and local co-ordinates\n\n6.20.1\tGeneral\n\nThis solution relates to the KI#5. The scheduled location time defined in TS\u00a023.273\u00a0[11] is used to get the Ranging/Sidelink positioning measurement data and the location of the Located UE at a same time, to achieve more accurate positioning of the target UE. When a scheduled location time is provided for periodic location request at step\u00a016, a UE should perform steps 23-25 some time in advance of the scheduled location time for the first periodic event report or some time in advance of the periodic interval expiration for each succeeding periodic event report in order to enable location measurements at step\u00a023 or step\u00a027 to occur near to each of these times, respectively.\n\n\tIf the event report allowed area with no reporting indication is received in step\u00a016, when UE detects the event happens, it further checks whether it is inside the event report allowed area. If yes, the steps 23 to 30c are performed. Otherwise, the steps 23 to 30c are skipped."

Therefore, a high number of users (e.g. thousands in stadium venues) are likely to want to terminate their access/service to the local hosting network and attempt a fairly simultaneous registration back to their home PLMN. The hosting network operator may also decide to switch off the local network while there still are many UEs that are connected to the local network. This may lead to a signaling peak in the home PLMN and result in longer time scales for users to re-register to/re-select their home PLMN. Therefore, it is desirable that user registrations are managed by spreading out the registration attempts over time and limiting the number of users attempting to register simultaneously, to avoid signaling overload and unnecessary waiting times for the returning users."

In the 5GC, dedicated network resources and network functionalities are separately customised for public security emergency service and video service to meet the isolation requirements, which ensures the independence of core network resources between different network slices. 5.18\tNetwork Sharing\n\n5.18.1\tGeneral concepts\n\nA network sharing architecture shall allow multiple participating operators to share resources of a single shared network according to agreed allocation schemes. The shared network includes a radio access network. The shared resources include radio resources.\n\nThe shared network operator allocates shared resources to the participating operators based on their planned and current needs and according to service level agreements.\n\nIn this Release of the specification, only the 5G Multi-Operator Core Network (5G MOCN) network sharing architecture, in which only the RAN is shared in 5G System, is supported."

A purpose of the link MTU size provisioning is to limit the size of the packets sent by the UE to avoid packet fragmentation in the backbone network between the UE and the UPF acting as PSA (and/or across the N6 reference point). Fragmentation within the backbone network creates a significant overhead. Therefore operators might desire to avoid it. The FPN processes the input images at different scales to allow for the detection of small-scale and large-scale features. The head may for instance segment the objects, infer a bounding box for the objects, or classify the objects.\n\nThe FPN backbone constitutes the most complex portion of the network and lends itself to be offloaded to the edge/cloud.

The main functionalities introduced here are the support of redundant transmission, QoS monitoring, dynamic division of the Packet Delay Budget, and enhancements of the session continuity mechanism.\n\nRedundant transmission for high-reliability communication\n\nSome URLLC services request very high reliability that hardly can be supported in an economical way by a single transport path. To support such services, a redundant transmission mechanism is specified. User packets are duplicated and simultaneously transferred to the receiver via two disjoint user plane paths. The redundant packets are then eliminated at the receiver side. An example reason for this shortcoming is that the latency and/or packet error rate increase due to interference in a radio cell. In such cases, it is critical that the application and/or application server is notified in a timely manner. Hence, the 5G system should be able to support QoS monitoring/assurance for URLLC services, V2X and vertical automation.\n\nFor more information on QoS assurance see Annex F. \n\nVertical automation systems are locally distributed and are typically served by wired and wireless communication networks of different types and with different characteristics. Therefore, diagnosis and fault analysis features for 5G systems are required. The 5G system needs to provide sufficient monitoring information as input for such diagnosis features.\n\nQoS monitoring can be used for the following activities: \n\n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of network operation;\n\n-\tassessing and assuring the dependability of the communication services;\n\n-\texcluding particular communication errors;\n\n-\tidentifying communication errors;\n\n-\tanalysing the location of an error including the geographic location of the involved network component (UE; front-haul component; core node);\n\n-\tactivation of application-related countermeasures.\n\nThis section provides requirements for both functionality and service exposure."

The NG-RAN is required to provide the QoS monitoring results on the RAN part of UL/DL packet delay measurement. The measurement of the UL/DL packet delay between NG-RAN and PSA UPF can be performed on different levels of granularities, i.e. per QoS Flow per UE level, or per GTP-U path level, subject to the operators' configuration. The AF may first initiate an AF Session with PCF and later subscribe to direct notification of QoS monitoring to PCF by invoking Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation. The QoS parameter(s) to be measured indicates the UL packet delay, DL packet delay, round trip packet delay or jitter between the UE and the UPF is to be monitored when the QoS Monitoring for URLLC is enabled for the service data flow.\n\n2.\tThe PCF makes the policy decision and initiates the PDU Session modification procedure as defined in clause\u00a04.3.3.2, steps 1b, 3b, 4-8b of TS\u00a023.502\u00a0[3].

An example of SUL is given in Annex B.\n\n6.10\tBandwidth Adaptation\n\nWith Bandwidth Adaptation (BA), the receive and transmit bandwidth of a UE need not be as large as the bandwidth of the cell and can be adjusted: the width can be ordered to change (e.g. to shrink during period of low activity to save power); the location can move in the frequency domain (e.g. to increase scheduling flexibility); and the subcarrier spacing can be ordered to change (e.g. to allow different services). This can, in general, be done in two ways: either by controlling the bit-rate used for encoding each media frame or by controlling when the generated packets are transmitted. \n\nNOTE\u00a01:\tThis bit-rate control is not to be confused with rate adaptation, which is described in clause\u00a010. The main purpose of the bitrate control is to reduce the risk that policing functions in the network drop media packets since the bandwidth of packets is temporarily exceeding the allowed bandwidth, which is typically configured in a static fashion. Rate adaptation is instead used to ensure that the used bandwidth is sufficiently low to avoid packet losses and extended delays when operating conditions change.\n\nNOTE\u00a02:\tControlling when packets are transmitted is called \"packet pacing\". The primary means for the adaptation in this range is adapting the source encoding while adapting the RTP packetization should remain unchanged. This includes adapting the frame range for video.\n\n-\tWhen adapting in this range, downwards rate adaptation should be fast while upwards rate adaptation should be relatively slow. This is because when these bandwidth properties are different then it is likely that an MBR>GBR bearer is used and the performance defined with the QoS parameters is only guaranteed when the bit rate does not exceed the GBR\u00a0[90].\n\n-\tThe bit rate range above the Maximum Desired Bandwidth up to the Maximum Supported Bandwidth (if different) is mainly intended for sending application layer redundancy, in case additional bandwidth is needed for this purpose."

At NAS level (see TS 23.501 [3]), the QoS flow is thus the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in a PDU session. A QoS flow is identified within a PDU session by a QoS Flow ID (QFI) carried in an encapsulation header over NG-U. A QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the PDU Session. A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System. User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU Session receives the same traffic forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). \n\nThe QFI is carried in an encapsulation header on N3 without any changes to the e2e packet header and is used to uniquely identify a PDU Session. the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the MA PDU Session. One difference compared to the Single-Access PDU Session is that in a MA PDU Session there can be separate user-plane tunnels between the AN and the PSA, each one associated with a different access.

However, the outcome as a result of the work item has the limitation that LTE-Uu interface using uplink/downlink was not utilized and only V2V (Vehicle-to-Vehicle) services were considered in a limited operation scenario (e.g., use of only a single carrier in Band 47, only GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) as synchronization source outside eNB coverage, etc.).

This can be achieved by a new function comparing the overlapping symbols from both FFT outputs and phase shifting one FFT output accordingly before the FFT outputs are merged. These observations confirm the analysis that LoS propagation model can be used in the tunnel.\n\n6.2.2\tChannel modelling for performance requirements\n\nBased on WID as follows, RAN4 is tasked to further study the channel model for FR2 HST, where the key question needs to be answer:\n\n-\tWhether or not single-tap per RRH channel model is assumed in UL direction; and\n\n-\tWhether single- or multi-tap model is assumed in DL direction.\n\nCompared with the FR1 counterpart, the major difference of having analog beamforming in FR2 should be considered in determining channel model for performance requirement. TS38.901 RMa LoS model, which is considered in open-space link budget analysis, can be reused in tunnel scenario. On the other hand, it is also worth noting that RMa LoS model does not capture the effects of rich reflection and scattering that likely exist in the tunnel propagation. From this viewpoint, other pathloss model such as TS38.901 UMa LoS and UMi street cayon LoS channel model might be more relevant for link budget study in the tunnel scenario as those models somewhat included the impact of reflection and scattering propagation in the pathloss.\n\nAs mentioned above, the LoS condition can be considered for most of the areas between the serving RRH and neighboring ones."
