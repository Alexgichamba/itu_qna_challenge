AR conversational service described in TR 26.998 [2] is a typical use cases for RTC, which enables end-users to directly communicate real-time media including AR/MR media contents as specified in TS 26.119 [3]. As identified in clause 8.4 of TR 26.998, there may be different options to enable such AR conversational service, for example re-use of parts of MTSI such as the IMS data channel or 5G Media Streaming for managed services. \n\nThe overall RTC architecture is shown in Figure 4.1-1 as below. 6\tXR Media Services\t10\n\n5\tTypical current deployment characteristics\t11\n\n5.1\tTypical streaming/broadcast video and audio bitrates\t11\n\n5.2\tTypical streaming/broadcast 360 VR bitrates\t11\n\n5.3\tTypical conversational speech/audio and video bitrates\t12\n\n5.4\tTypical uplink A/V streaming of A/V, including 360 VR content\t12\n\n5.4.1\tProfessional production content bitrates\t12\n\n5.4.2\tLive uplink contribution professional content bitrates\t13\n\n5.4.3\tUser generated content\t14\n\n5.5\tTypical Traffic Characteristics for Cloud gaming\t14\n\n5.

Therefore, for instance the interaction between two parties seating next to each other in the virtual space (e.g. when these parties turn to each other when talking) is seen by all participants in the same way.

While the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE and last serving gNB store the UE 5G AS security context which can be reactivated when the UE transitions from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED. The gNB and the UE keep the current AS key KRRCint. Figure 10.12.2-3: Support of Activity Notification in MR-DC with 5GC with RRC_Inactive - SCG configuration suspended in SN\n\nFigure 10.12.2-3 shows how Activity Notification function interacts with NG-RAN functions for RRC_INACTIVE and SN Modification procedures in order to keep the full MR-DC NG-RAN resources established for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE. When the UE transits successfully back to RRC_CONNECTED, lower layer MCG and SCG configurations are restored or reconfigured by means of RRC (Connection) Resume.\n\n1.\tThe SN notifies the MN about user data inactivity for SN terminated bearers.\n\n2. In EN-DC, the SCG configuration is kept in the UE during suspension. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with EN-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. Otherwise, the UE releases the SCG configuration (but not the radio bearer configuration) during resumption initiation.\n\nIn MR-DC with 5GC, the UE stores the PDCP/SDAP configuration and the SCG configuration when moving to RRC Inactive. During connection resumption, if the UE supports resuming with MR-DC, the UE can be configured to release, restore, or reconfigure the SCG configuration. The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA carrier frequency.\n\nThe suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered. The SN provides configuration data within an SN RRC reconfiguration message.\n\n11-14.\tThe RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure commences.\n\n\n\nMR-DC with 5GC with RRC_INACTIVE - SCG configuration suspended in SN\n\nThe Activity Notification function may be used to enable MR-DC with 5GC with RRC_INACTIVE operation. The MN node may decide, after inactivity is reported from the SN and also MN resources show no activity, to send the UE to RRC_INACTIVE, while keeping the SCG configuration. Resumption to RRC_CONNECTED may take place after activity is reported from the SN for SN terminated bearers. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered.\n\nThe resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN or for SDT. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s) and/or multicast MRB(s), if configured."

The direct commercial relationship may be with either the serving network operator if known directly by the home environment or a network operator known to the home environment.

The IOI is composed of one pair of originating IOI and terminating IOI. Additionally, one or more transit IOI values may occur.

This is dependant on when updated information is avialable in the P-CSCF.\n\n4.5.4\tInter operator identifier (IOI)\n\nThe Inter Operator Identifier (IOI) is a globally unique identifier to share between sending and receiving networks, service providers or content providers.\n\nThe sending network populates the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter of the P-Charging-Vector header field in a request and thereby identifies the operator network from which the request was sent.

        "category": "Standards overview",
        "context": "In Rel-17, however, the user-plane resources over 3GPP access may be established in EPC (through a PDC Connection). In other words, instead of using a 3GPP access connected to 5GC, a 3GPP access (e.g., E-UTRAN) connected to EPC may be used by the MA PDU Session. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU Session can simultaneously send traffic over a 3GPP access connected to EPC and over a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. More details can be found in [2], clause 4.22.2.3. More specifically, the following enhancements were specified for the ATSSS in Rel-17. They are grouped into two main categories: (1) Steering mode enhancements, and (2) supporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP access leg over EPC.\n\nSteering mode enhancements:\n\n- \tPMF measurements per QoS flow: To decide how to steer the traffic of a data flow, access network performance measurements may need to be taken, to estimate the RTT and/or the Packet Loss Rate over each of the accesses of a MA PDU Session. A threshold value may be either a value for RTT or a value for Packet Loss Rate (PLR). For more details, see [1], clause 5.32.8.\n\nSupporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP access leg over EPC:\n\n-\tA Multi Access (MA) PDU Session established over the 5G core (5GC) network typically has user-plane resources over a 3GPP access connected to 5GC and user-plane resources over a non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. In Rel-17, however, the user-plane resources over 3GPP access may be established in EPC (through a PDC Connection). This solution also supports the mobility procedure from 5GS to EPS. It applies the similar mechanism as the solution for MA-PDU session with one leg via non-3GPP access to 5GC and one leg via 3GPP access to EPC, as defined in Rel-17, with a bit impact on the ePDG and PGW-C+SMF to support APCO IE to transport the ATSSS related parameters.\n\n8\tConclusions\n\nEditor's note:\tThis clause enlists the conclusions of the study, including agreements for work to be done in the normative phase. The ATSSS work in Rel-17 (aka ATSSS_ph2) specified enhancements for supporting the following features (see [3]):\n\na) \tATSSS steering mode enhancements (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93, clause 8.1); and\n\nb) \tSupport of MA PDU Sessions with a 3GPP access over EPC and a non-3GPP access over 5GC (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93, clause 8.3).\n\nMore specifically, the following enhancements were specified for the ATSSS in Rel-17.

        "context": "5.4.9\tWake Up Signal Assistance\n\n5.4.9.1\tGeneral\n\nThe RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE's idle mode power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE's paging occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the paging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not be paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if their WUS is transmitted (see TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[52]).\n\nTo avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells (e.g. PDCCH skipping and Search Space Set Group switching). Both CDRX and PDCCH monitoring adaptation offer the possibility to reduce UE power consumption by alternating between active and sleep periods, by switching the monitoring frequency of PDCCH, and/or by skipping some of the PDCCH monitoring occasions.\n\nUE power saving schemes can be optimally configured according to the traffic characteristics of XR traffic described above to guarantee the delivering of a packet within the PDB and at the same time maximize the power saving gain. Therefore, UE power saving scheme would benefit from application awareness in the form of additional information either carried over the user plane or new assistance information delivered using the control plane. Any new data analytics agreed as part of this Key Issue that need to be provided by NWDAF need to be studied and agreed in FS_eNA_Ph3.\n\n5.5\tKey Issue #5: Assistance data provisioning for low power high accuracy GNSS positioning\n\n5.5.1\tDescription\n\nThe GNSS assistance data could help reduce UE GNSS receivers' power consumption and increase the position accuracy. Nowadays, UE usually gets the assistance data from internet through user-plane. However, using a user plane based way means that UE must active a PDU Session, which leads to higher power consummation. Figure 4.3.21.3-1: Core Network assisted eNodeB parameters tuning\n\n4.3.21.4\tWake Up Signal Assistance\n\n4.3.21.4.1\tGeneral\n\nThe RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE's idle mode power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE's paging occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the paging occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not be paged if their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if their WUS is transmitted (see TS\u00a036.304\u00a0[34]). The work item of UE power saving in NR includes the power saving techniques, such as DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation in CONNECTED state, fast transition out of CONNECTED state, and reduced RRM measurements in idle/inactive states. The UE assistance information is part of the work to enable the UE to feedback its preferred configuration to achieve desired power saving. \n\nThe UE power saving work in Rel-16 focuses on the power saving techniques in CONNECTED state, which includes DRX adaptation, cross-slot scheduling, maximum MIMO layer adaptation, and fast transition out of CONNECTED state. The RRM measurement reductions are the power saving techniques specified in idle/inactive states.UE assistance information is supported for the UE to feedback its preferred configuration of the specific power saving technique.\n\nPower Saving Techniques in CONNECTED state\n\nThe power saving techniques are dynamically triggered by L1 signaling indicated from PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel or semi-statically configured by RRC signaling.The PDCCH-based power saving signal/channel reuses the existing PDCCH search space and CORESET configurations with dynamic TCI states with DCI field indicating the adaptation to achieve UE power saving, such as UE wakeup in the DRX operation, cross-slot scheduling, and maximum MIMO layer adaptation through BWP switching. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be in a Non-Allowed Area if none of the broadcast TAIs is Allowed. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be in an Allowed Area if at least one broadcast TAI is allowed.\n\n5.4.12\tPaging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping Assistance\n\n5.4.12.1\tGeneral\n\nThe RAN and UE may use a Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping (PEIPS) to reduce the UE's power consumption in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE over NR (see TS\u00a038.304\u00a0[50])."
